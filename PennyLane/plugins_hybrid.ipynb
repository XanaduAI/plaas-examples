    "A non-Gaussian circuit\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We first consider a photonic circuit which is similar in spirit to the\n",
    "[qubit rotation](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation.html#qubit-rotation) circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](.img/plugins_hybrid_photon_redirection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking this down, step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **We start the computation with two qumode subsystems**. In\n",
    "    PennyLane, we use the shorthand 'wires' to refer to quantum\n",
    "    subsystems, whether they are qumodes, qubits, or any other kind of\n",
    "    quantum register.\n",
    "2.  **Prepare the state** $\\left|1,0\\right\\rangle$. That is, the first\n",
    "    wire (wire 0) is prepared in a single-photon state, while the second\n",
    "    wire (wire 1) is prepared in the vacuum state. The former state is\n",
    "    non-Gaussian, necessitating the use of the `'strawberryfields.fock'`\n",
    "    backend device.\n",
    "3.  **Both wires are then incident on a beamsplitter**, with free\n",
    "    parameters $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. Here, we have the convention that\n",
    "    the beamsplitter transmission amplitude is $t=\\cos\\theta$, and the\n",
    "    reflection amplitude is $r=e^{i\\phi}\\sin\\theta$. See\n",
    "    [Quantum operations](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/operations.html)\n",
    "    for a full list of operation conventions.\n",
    "4.  **Finally, we measure the mean photon number**\n",
    "    $\\left\\langle \\hat{n}\\right\\rangle$ of the second wire, where\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\hat{n} = \\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    is the number operator, acting on the Fock basis number states, such\n",
    "    that $\\hat{n}\\left|n\\right\\rangle = n\\left|n\\right\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is to optimize the beamsplitter parameters\n",
    "$(\\theta, \\phi)$ such that the expected photon number of the second wire\n",
    "is **maximized**. Since the beamsplitter is a passive optical element\n",
    "that preserves the total photon number, this to the output state\n",
    "$\\left|0,1\\right\\rangle$ — i.e., when the incident photon from the first\n",
    "wire has been 'redirected' to the second wire.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exact calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare with later numerical results, we can first consider what\n",
    "happens analytically. The initial state of the circuit is\n",
    "$\\left|\\psi_0\\right\\rangle=\\left|1,0\\right\\rangle$, and the output state\n",
    "of the system is of the form\n",
    "$\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = a\\left|1, 0\\right\\rangle + b\\left|0,1\\right\\rangle$,\n",
    "where $|a|^2+|b|^2=1$. We may thus write the output state as a vector in\n",
    "this computational basis,\n",
    "$\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix}a & b\\end{bmatrix}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beamsplitter acts on this two-dimensional subspace as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = B(\\theta, \\phi)\\left|1, 0\\right\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "     \\cos\\theta & -e^{-i\\phi}\\sin\\theta\\\\\n",
    "     e^{i\\phi}\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta\n",
    " \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "     \\cos\\theta\\\\\n",
    "     e^{i\\phi} \\sin\\theta\n",
    " \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the mean photon number of the second wire is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left\\langle{\\hat{n}_1}\\right\\rangle = \\langle{\\psi}\\mid{\\hat{n}_1}\\mid{\\psi}\\rangle = |e^{i\\phi} \\sin\\theta|^2\n",
    "\\langle{0,1}\\mid{\\hat{n}_1}\\mid{0,1}\\rangle = \\sin^2 \\theta.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  $0\\leq \\left\\langle \\hat{n}_1\\right\\rangle\\leq 1$: the output of the\n",
    "    quantum circuit is bound between 0 and 1;\n",
    "2.  $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\left\\langle \\hat{n}_1\\right\\rangle=0$:\n",
    "    the output of the quantum circuit is independent of the beamsplitter\n",
    "    phase $\\phi$;\n",
    "3.  The output of the quantum circuit above is maximised when\n",
    "    $\\theta=(2m+1)\\pi/2$ for $m\\in\\mathbb{Z}_0$.\n",
