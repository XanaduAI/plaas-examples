    "*Author: PennyLane dev team. Last updated: 16 Oct 2020.*\n",

    "This tutorial demonstrates the basic working principles of PennyLane for\n",
    "continuous-variable (CV) photonic devices. For more details about\n",
    "photonic quantum computing, the [Strawberry Fields\n",

    "The quantum circuit\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For this basic tutorial, we will consider a special subset of CV\n",
    "operations: the *Gaussian transformations*. We work with the following\n",
    "simple Gaussian circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](.img/gaussian_transformation.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is this circuit doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **We begin with one wire (qumode) in the vacuum state**. Note that\n",
    "    we use the same notation $|0\\rangle$ for the initial state as the\n",
    "    previous qubit tutorial. In a photonic CV system, this state is the\n",
    "    *vacuum state*, i.e., the state with no photons in the wire.\n",
    "2.  **We displace the qumode**. The displacement gate linearly shifts\n",
    "    the state of the qumode in phase space. The vacuum state is centered\n",
    "    at the origin in phase space, while the displaced state will be\n",
    "    centered at the point $\\alpha$.\n",
    "3.  **We rotate the qumode**. This is another linear transformation in\n",
    "    phase space, albeit a rotation (by angle $\\phi$) instead of\n",
    "    a displacement.\n",
    "4.  **Finally, we measure the mean photon number**\n",
    "    $\\langle\\hat{n}\\rangle =\n",
    "    \\langle\\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{a}\\rangle$. This quantity, which tells\n",
    "    us the average amount of photons in the final state, is proportional\n",
    "    to the energy of the photonic system.\n",
