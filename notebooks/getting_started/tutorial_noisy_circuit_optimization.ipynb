There are lots of exciting\nideas and algorithms in quantum computing and quantum machine learning,\nbut how well do they survive the reality of today's noisy devices?\n\n## Background\n\nQuantum pure-state simulators are great and readily available in\na number of quantum software packages.\nThey allow us to experiment, prototype, test, and validate algorithms\nand research ideas---up to a certain number of qubits, at least.\n\nBut present-day hardware is not ideal. We're forced to confront\ndecoherence, bit flips, amplitude damping, and so on. Does the\npresence of noise in near-term devices impact their use in,\nfor example,\n:doc:`variational quantum algorithms </glossary/variational_circuit>`?\nWon't our models, trained so carefully in simulators, fall apart\nwhen we run on noisy devices?\n\nIn fact, there is some optimism that variational algorithms may be\nthe best type of algorithms on near-term devices, and could\nhave an in-built adaptability to noise that more rigid\ntextbook algorithms do not possess.\nVariational algorithms are somewhat robust against the fact\nthat the device they are run on may not be ideal. Being variational\nin nature, they can be tuned to \"work around\" noise to some extent.\n\nQuantum machine learning leverages a lot of tools from its\nclassical counterpart. Fortunately, there is great evidence that\nmachine learning algorithms can not only be robust to noise, but\ncan even benefit from it!\nExamples include the use of\n`reduced-precision arithmetic in deep learning <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3045118.3045303>`_,\nthe strong performance of\n`stochastic gradient descent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent>`_,\nand the use of \"dropout\" noise to\n`prevent overfitting <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf>`_.\n\nWith this evidence to motivate us, we can still hope to find,\nextract, and work with the underlying quantum \"signal\"\nthat is influenced by a device's inherent noise.\n\n## Noisy circuits: creating a Bell state\n\nLet's consider a simple quantum circuit which performs a standard\nquantum information task: the creation of an entangled\nstate and the measurement of a\n`Bell inequality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem>`_\n(also known as the\n`CHSH inequality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality>`_).\n\nSince we'll be dealing with noise, we'll need to use a simulator\nthat supports noise and density-state representations of quantum\nstates (in contrast to many simulators, which use a pure-state\nrepresentation).\n\nFortunately, `Cirq <https://cirq.readthedocs.io>`_ provides mixed-state\nsimulators and noisy operations natively, so we can use the\n`PennyLane-Cirq plugin <https://pennylane-cirq.readthedocs.io>`_\nto carry out our noisy simulations.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndev = qml.device(\"cirq.mixedsimulator\", wires=2, shots=1000)\n\n# CHSH observables\nA1 = qml.PauliZ(0)\nA2 = qml.PauliX(0)\nB1 = qml.Hermitian(np.array([[1, 1], [1, -1]]) / np.sqrt(2), wires=1)\nB2 = qml.Hermitian(np.array([[1, -1], [-1, -1]]) / np.sqrt(2), wires=1)\nCHSH_observables = [A1 @ B1, A1 @ B2, A2 @ B1, A2 @ B2]\n\n# subcircuit for creating an entangled pair of qubits\ndef bell_pair():\n    qml.Hadamard(wires=0)\n    qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])\n\n# circuits for measuring each distinct observable\n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef measure_A1B1():\n    bell_pair()\n    return qml.expval(A1 @ B1)\n\n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef measure_A1B2():\n    bell_pair()\n    return qml.expval(A1 @ B2)\n\n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef measure_A2B1():\n    bell_pair()\n    return qml.expval(A2 @ B1)\n\n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef measure_A2B2():\n    bell_pair()\n    return qml.expval(A2 @ B2)\n\ncircuits = qml.QNodeCollection([measure_A1B1,\n                                measure_A1B2,\n                                measure_A2B1,\n                                measure_A2B2])\n\n# now we measure each circuit and construct the CHSH inequality\nexpvals = circuits()\n\n# The CHSH operator is A1 @ B1 + A1 @ B2 + A2 @ B1 - A2 @ B2\nCHSH_expval = np.sum(expvals[:3]) - expvals[3]\nprint(CHSH_expval)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The output here is $2\\sqrt{2}$, which is the maximal value of the\nCHSH inequality.
