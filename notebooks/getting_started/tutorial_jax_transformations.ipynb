We'll show examples of how to \ndo gradient descent with ``jax.grad``, run quantum circuits in parallel\nusing ``jax.vmap``, compile and optimize simulations with ``jax.jit``,\nand control and seed the random nature of quantum computer simulations\nwith ``jax.random``. By the end of this tutorial you should feel just as comfortable\ntransforming quantum computing programs with JAX as you do transforming your \nneural networks.\n\nIf this is your first time reading PennyLane code, we recommend going through\nthe :doc:`basic tutorial </demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation>`\nfirst. It's all in vanilla NumPy, so you should be able to \neasily transfer what you learn to JAX when you come back.\n\nWith that said, we begin by importing PennyLane, JAX,  the JAX-provided version of NumPy and\nset up a two-qubit device for computations.
