Last updated: 25 June 2022*\n\nThe ultimate goal of computational quantum chemistry is to unravel the\nquantum effects that determine the structure and properties of molecules. Reaching\nthis goal is challenging since the characteristic energies associated with\nthese effects, e.g., the electronic correlation energy, are typically a tiny fraction\nof the total energy of the molecule.\n\nAccurate molecular properties can be computed from the wave function describing the\ninteracting electrons in a molecule. The **electronic** wave function\n$\\Psi(r)$ satisfies the `Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation>`_\n\n\\begin{align}H_e \\Psi(r) = E \\Psi(r),\\end{align}\n\nwhere $H_e$ and $E$ denote the electronic Hamiltonian and the\ntotal energy of the molecule, respectively. When solving the latter equation,\nthe nuclei of the molecule can be treated as point particles whose coordinates\nare fixed [#BornOpp1927]_. In this approximation, both the total energy and\nthe electronic Hamiltonian depend parametrically on the nuclear coordinates.\n\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to use PennyLane to build a\nrepresentation of the electronic Hamiltonian $H_e$ that can be used to perform\n**quantum** simulations of molecules [#yudong2019]_. First, we show how to define\nthe structure of the molecule in terms of the symbols and the coordinates of\nthe atoms. Next, we describe how to solve the `Hartree-Fock\nequations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method>`_ for the target\nmolecule. Finally, we discuss some advanced features that can be used to simulate\nmore complicated systems.\n\nLet's get started!\n\n## Defining the molecular structure\nIn this example we construct the electronic Hamiltonian of the water molecule.\n\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/quantum_chemistry/water_structure.png\n    :width: 30%\n    :align: center\n\nThe structure of a molecule is defined by the symbols and the nuclear coordinates of\nits constituent atoms. It can be specified using different `chemical file formats\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_file_format>`_. Within PennyLane, the molecular\nstructure is defined by providing a list with the atomic symbols and a one-dimensional\narray with the nuclear coordinates in\n`atomic units <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree_atomic_units>`_.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import numpy as np\n\nsymbols = [\"H\", \"O\", \"H\"]\ncoordinates = np.array([-0.0399, -0.0038, 0.0, 1.5780, 0.8540, 0.0, 2.7909, -0.5159, 0.0])"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The :func:`~.pennylane.qchem.read_structure` function can also be used to read the\nmolecular geometry from an external file.\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from pennylane import qchem\n\nsymbols, coordinates = qchem.read_structure(\"h2o.xyz\")"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The xyz format is supported.\n\n## Solving the Hartree-Fock equations\nThe molecule's electronic Hamiltonian is commonly represented using the\n`second-quantization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_quantization>`_ formalism,\nwhich we will explore in more detail in the\nnext section. To that aim, a basis of **single-particle** states needs to be chosen.\nIn quantum chemistry these states are the\n`molecular orbitals <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital>`_\nwhich describe the wave function of a single electron in the molecule.\n\nMolecular orbitals are typically represented as a linear combination of **atomic orbitals**.\nThe expansion coefficients in the atomic basis are calculated using the\n`Hartree-Fock (HF) method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method>`_.\nIn the HF approximation, each electron in the molecule is treated as an **independent**\nparticle that moves under the influence of the Coulomb potential due to the nuclei, and a mean\nfield generated by all other electrons [#pople1977]_. The optimized coefficients are precisely\nwhat we need to build the second-quantized Hamiltonian.\n\nPennyLane provides a differentiable Hartree-Fock solver and the functionality to construct a\nfully-differentiable molecular Hamiltonian.\n\n## Building the Hamiltonian\nIn the second quantization formalism, the electronic wave function of the molecule\nis represented in the occupation number basis. For $M$ *spin* molecular\norbitals, the elements of this basis are labelled as\n$\\vert n_0, n_1, \\dots, n_{M-1} \\rangle$, where $n_i = 0,1$\nindicates the occupation of each orbital. In this representation, the electronic\nHamiltonian is given by\n\n\\begin{align}H = \\sum_{p,q} h_{pq} c_p^\\dagger c_q +\n    \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{p,q,r,s} h_{pqrs} c_p^\\dagger c_q^\\dagger c_r c_s,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $c^\\dagger$ and $c$ are the electron creation\nand annihilation operators, respectively, and the coefficients\n$h_{pq}$ and $h_{pqrs}$ denote the one- and two-electron\nCoulomb integrals [#ref_integrals]_ evaluated using the Hartree-Fock\norbitals.\n\nWe can use the states of $M$ qubits to encode any element\nof the occupation number basis\n\n\\begin{align}\\vert n_0, n_1, \\dots, n_{M-1} \\rangle \\rightarrow \\vert q_0 q_1 \\cdots q_{M-1} \\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nThis implies that we need to map the fermionic operators onto operators\nthat act on qubits. This can be done by using the\n`Jordan-Wigner <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan-Wigner_transformation>`_\ntransformation [#seeley2012]_ which allows us to decompose the fermionic Hamiltonian\ninto a linear combination of the tensor product of Pauli operators\n\n\\begin{align}H = \\sum_j C_j \\otimes_i \\sigma_i^{(j)},\\end{align}\n\nwhere $C_j$ is a scalar coefficient and $\\sigma_i$ represents an\nelement of the Pauli group $\\{ I, X, Y, Z \\}$.\n\nIn PennyLane we have the :func:`~.pennylane.qchem.molecular_hamiltonian`\nfunction which encapsulates all the steps explained above.
