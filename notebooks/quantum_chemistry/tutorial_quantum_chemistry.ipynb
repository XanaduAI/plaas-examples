Last updated: 25 June 2022*\n\nThe ultimate goal of computational quantum chemistry is to unravel the\nquantum effects that determine the structure and properties of\nmolecules. Reaching this goal is challenging since the characteristic\nenergies associated with these effects, e.g., the electronic correlation\nenergy, are typically a tiny fraction of the total energy of the\nmolecule.\n\nAccurate molecular properties can be computed from the wave function\ndescribing the interacting electrons in a molecule. The **electronic**\nwave function $\\Psi(r)$ satisfies the [Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation)\n\n$$H_e \\Psi(r) = E \\Psi(r),$$\n\nwhere $H_e$ and $E$ denote the electronic Hamiltonian and the total\nenergy of the molecule, respectively. When solving the latter equation,\nthe nuclei of the molecule can be treated as point particles whose\ncoordinates are fixed. In this approximation, both the total energy and\nthe electronic Hamiltonian depend parametrically on the nuclear\ncoordinates.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to use PennyLane to build a\nrepresentation of the electronic Hamiltonian $H_e$ that can be used to\nperform **quantum** simulations of molecules. First, we show how to\ndefine the structure of the molecule in terms of the symbols and the\ncoordinates of the atoms. Next, we describe how to solve the\n[Hartree-Fock\nequations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method)\nfor the target molecule. Finally, we discuss some advanced features that\ncan be used to simulate more complicated systems.\n\nLet\\'s get started!\n\nDefining the molecular structure\n--------------------------------\n\nIn this example we construct the electronic Hamiltonian of the water\nmolecule.\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/water_structure.png)\n\nThe structure of a molecule is defined by the symbols and the nuclear\ncoordinates of its constituent atoms. It can be specified using\ndifferent [chemical file\nformats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_file_format). Within\nPennyLane, the molecular structure is defined by providing a list with\nthe atomic symbols and a one-dimensional array with the nuclear\ncoordinates in [atomic\nunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree_atomic_units).\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import numpy as np\n\nsymbols = [\"H\", \"O\", \"H\"]\ncoordinates = np.array([-0.0399, -0.0038, 0.0, 1.5780, 0.8540, 0.0, 2.7909, -0.5159, 0.0])"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The `read_structure()`\nfunction can also be used to read the molecular geometry from an\nexternal file.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from pennylane import qchem\n\nsymbols, coordinates = qchem.read_structure(\"h2o.xyz\")"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The xyz format is supported.\n\nSolving the Hartree-Fock equations\n==================================\n\nThe molecule\\'s electronic Hamiltonian is commonly represented using the\n[second-quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_quantization)\nformalism, which we will explore in more detail in the next section. To\nthat aim, a basis of **single-particle** states needs to be chosen. In\nquantum chemistry these states are the [molecular\norbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital) which\ndescribe the wave function of a single electron in the molecule.\n\nMolecular orbitals are typically represented as a linear combination of\n**atomic orbitals**. The expansion coefficients in the atomic basis are\ncalculated using the [Hartree-Fock (HF)\nmethod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method). In\nthe HF approximation, each electron in the molecule is treated as an\n**independent** particle that moves under the influence of the Coulomb\npotential due to the nuclei, and a mean field generated by all other\nelectrons. The optimized coefficients are precisely what we need to\nbuild the second-quantized Hamiltonian.\n\nPennyLane provides a differentiable Hartree-Fock solver and the\nfunctionality to construct a fully-differentiable molecular Hamiltonian.\n\nBuilding the Hamiltonian\n========================\n\nIn the second quantization formalism, the electronic wave function of\nthe molecule is represented in the occupation number basis. For $M$\n*spin* molecular orbitals, the elements of this basis are labelled as\n$\\vert n_0, n_1, \\dots, n_{M-1} \\rangle$, where $n_i = 0,1$ indicates\nthe occupation of each orbital. In this representation, the electronic\nHamiltonian is given by\n\n$$H = \\sum_{p,q} h_{pq} c_p^\\dagger c_q +\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{p,q,r,s} h_{pqrs} c_p^\\dagger c_q^\\dagger c_r c_s,$$\n\nwhere $c^\\dagger$ and $c$ are the electron creation and annihilation\noperators, respectively, and the coefficients $h_{pq}$ and $h_{pqrs}$\ndenote the one- and two-electron Coulomb integrals evaluated using the\nHartree-Fock orbitals.\n\nWe can use the states of $M$ qubits to encode any element of the\noccupation number basis\n\n$$\\vert n_0, n_1, \\dots, n_{M-1} \\rangle \\rightarrow \\vert q_0 q_1 \\cdots q_{M-1} \\rangle.$$\n\nThis implies that we need to map the fermionic operators onto operators\nthat act on qubits. This can be done by using the\n[Jordan-Wigner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan-Wigner_transformation)\ntransformation which allows us to decompose the fermionic Hamiltonian\ninto a linear combination of the tensor product of Pauli operators\n\n$$H = \\sum_j C_j \\otimes_i \\sigma_i^{(j)},$$\n\nwhere $C_j$ is a scalar coefficient and $\\sigma_i$ represents an element\nof the Pauli group $\\{ I, X, Y, Z \\}$.\n\nIn PennyLane we have the\n`molecular_hamiltonian()`\nfunction which encapsulates all the steps explained above. It simplifies\nthe process of building the electronic Hamiltonian to a single line of\ncode.
