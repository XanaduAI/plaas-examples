Posted: 23 July 2021. Last updated: 23 July 2021*\n\nThe term \"chemical reaction\" is another name for the transformation of molecules -- the breaking and \nforming of bonds. They are characterized by an energy barrier that determines\nthe likelihood that a reaction takes place. The energy landscapes formed by these barriers are the\nkey to understanding how chemical reactions occur, at the deepest possible level.\n\n.. figure:: /demonstrations/vqe_bond_dissociation/reaction.png\n    :width: 50%\n    :align: center\n\n    An example chemical reaction.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to use PennyLane to simulate chemical reactions by\nconstructing potential energy surfaces for molecular transformations. In the process, you will\nlearn how quantum computers can be used to calculate equilibrium bond lengths, activation energy\nbarriers, and reaction rates. As illustrative\nexamples, we use tools implemented in PennyLane to study diatomic bond dissociation and reactions\ninvolving the exchange of hydrogen atoms.\n\n\n## Potential Energy Surfaces \n\n`Potential energy surfaces (PES) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy_surface>`_\ndescribe the energy of molecules for different positions of\nits atoms. The concept originates from the fact that the electrons are much lighter than protons\nand neutrons, so they will adjust instantaneously to the new positions of the nuclei. This leads\nto a separation of the nuclear and electronic parts of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, meaning we only need\nto solve the electronic equation:\n\n\\begin{align}H(R)|\\Psi \\rangle =  E|\\Psi\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nFrom this perspective arises the concept of the electronic energy of a molecule, $E(R)$,\nas a function of nuclear coordinates $R$. The energy $E(R)$ is the expectation value\nof the molecular Hamiltonian, $E(R)=\\langle \\Psi_0|H(R)|\\Psi_0\\rangle$, taken\nwith respect to the ground state $|\\Psi_0(R)\\rangle$. The potential energy surface is\nprecisely this function $E(R)$, which connects energies to different geometries of the\nmolecule. It gives us a visual tool to understand chemical reactions by associating\nstable molecules (reactants and products) with local minima, transition states with peaks,\nand by identifying the possible routes for a chemical reaction to occur.\n\nTo build the potential energy surface, we compute the energy for fixed positions of the nuclei,\nand subsequently adjust the positions of the nuclei in incremental steps, computing the energies at each new configuration.\nThe obtained set of energies corresponds to a grid of nuclear positions and the plot of\n$E(R)$ gives rise to the potential energy surface.\n\n\n.. figure:: /demonstrations/vqe_bond_dissociation/pes.png\n    :width: 75%\n    :align: center\n\n    Illustration of a potential energy surface for a diatomic molecule.\n\n## Bond dissociation in a Hydrogen molecule \n\nWe now construct a potential energy surface and use it to compute equilibrium bond lengths and\nthe bond dissociation energy. We begin with the simplest of molecules: $H_2$.\nThe formation or breaking of the $H-H$ bond is also the most\nelementary of all reactions:\n\n\\begin{align}H_2 \\rightarrow H + H.\\end{align}\n\nUsing a minimal `basis set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STO-nG_basis_sets>`_,\nthis molecular system can be described by two electrons in four\nspin-orbitals. When mapped to a qubit representation, we need a total of four qubits.\nThe *Hartree-Fock (HF) state* is represented as $|1100\\rangle$, where the two\nlowest-energy orbitals are occupied, and the remaining two are unoccupied.\n\nWe design a quantum circuit consisting of :class:`~.pennylane.SingleExcitation` and\n:class:`~.pennylane.DoubleExcitation` gates applied to the Hartree-Fock state.

However, a deeper\nquantitative understanding of chemical reactions can be achieved by performing theoretical\nsimulations of the mechanisms for forming and breaking bonds. This tutorial described how\nsimple chemical reactions can be simulated using quantum algorithms that reconstruct\npotential energy surfaces, allowing us to identify reactants and products as minima of the\nenergy, and transition states as local maxima. These results can then be used to calculate\nactivation energies and reaction rates. The goal (and challenge!) for quantum computing is to\nimprove both hardware and algorithms to reach the regime where providing accurate simulations\nbecomes intractable for existing methods. If successful, this quest will\nallow us to understand the properties of quantum systems in ways that have so far been out of\nreach.\n\n\n\n\n## References\n\n..
