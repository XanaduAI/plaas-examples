These are operations that can be used to construct any kind of\nparticle-conserving circuit. We discuss single and double excitation gates, which are particular\ntypes of Givens rotations that play an important role in quantum chemistry. Notably,\ncontrolled single excitation gates are universal for particle-conserving unitaries. You will also\nlearn how to use these gates to build arbitrary states of a fixed number of particles.\n\nParticle-conserving unitaries\n-----------------------------\n\nUnderstanding the electronic structure of molecules is arguably the central problem in quantum chemistry.\nQuantum computers tackle this problem by using systems of qubits to\nrepresent the quantum states of the electrons. One method is to consider a\ncollection of `molecular orbitals <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital>`_, which\ncapture the three-dimensional region of space occupied by the electrons. Each orbital can be\noccupied by at most two electrons, each with a different spin orientation. In this case we refer to\n*spin orbitals* that can be occupied by a single electron.\n\nThe state of electrons in a molecule can then be described by specifying how the\norbitals are occupied. The `Jordan-Wigner representation\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93Wigner_transformation>`_  provides a\nconvenient way to do this: we associate a qubit with each spin orbital and\nuse its states to represent occupied $|1\\rangle$ or unoccupied\n$|0\\rangle$ spin orbitals.\n\nAn $n$-qubit state with `Hamming weight <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight>`_\n$k$, i.e., with $k$ qubits in state $|1\\rangle$, represents a state of\n$k$ electrons in $n$ spin orbitals. For example $|1010\\rangle$ is a state of\ntwo electrons in two spin orbitals. More generally, superpositions over all basis states with a\nfixed number of particles are valid states of the electrons in a molecule. These are states such as\n\n\\begin{align}|\\psi\\rangle = c_1|1100\\rangle + c_2|1010\\rangle + c_3|1001\\rangle + c_4|0110\\rangle +\n    c_5|0101\\rangle + c_6|0011\\rangle,\\end{align}\n\nfor some coefficients $c_i$.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/givens_rotations/orbitals+states.png\n    :align: center\n    :width: 50%\n\n    States of a system with six spin orbitals and three electrons. Orbitals are for illustration;\n    they correspond to carbon dioxide, which has more electrons and orbitals.\n\nBecause the number of electrons in a molecule is\nfixed, any transformation must conserve the number of particles. We refer to these as\n**particle-conserving unitaries**. When designing quantum circuits and algorithms for quantum\nchemistry, it is desirable to employ only particle-conserving gates that guarantee that the\nstates of the system remain valid. This raises the questions: what are the simplest\nparticle-conserving unitaries? Like Legos, how can they be used to construct any quantum circuit for\nquantum chemistry applications?\n\nGivens rotations\n----------------\n\nConsider single-qubit gates. In their most general form, they perform the transformation\n\n\\begin{align}U|0\\rangle &= a |0\\rangle + b |1\\rangle,\\\\\n    U|1\\rangle &= c |1\\rangle + d |0\\rangle,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $|a|^2+|b|^2=|c|^2+|d|^2=1$ and $ab^* + cd^*=0$. This gate is\nparticle-conserving only if $b=d=0$, which means that the only single-qubit gates that\npreserve particle number are diagonal gates of the form\n\n\\begin{align}U = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    e^{i\\theta} & 0\\\\\n    0 & e^{i\\phi}\n    \\end{pmatrix}.\\end{align}\n\nOn their own, these gates are not very interesting. They can only be used to change the\nrelative phases of states in a superposition; they cannot be used to create and control such\nsuperpositions. So let's take a look at two-qubit gates.\n\nBasis states of two qubits can be categorized depending on\ntheir number of particles.\n\nWe have:\n\n- $|00\\rangle$ with zero particles,\n- $|01\\rangle,|10\\rangle$ with one particle, and\n- $|11\\rangle$ with two particles.\n\nWe can now consider transformations that couple the states $|01\\rangle,|10\\rangle$. These\nare gates of the form\n\n\\begin{align}U|01\\rangle &= a |01\\rangle + b |10\\rangle\\\\\n    U|10\\rangle &= c |10\\rangle + d |01\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nThis should be familiar: the unitary has the same form as a single-qubit gate, except that the\nstates $|01\\rangle, |10\\rangle$ respectively take the place of $|0\\rangle,\n|1\\rangle$. This correspondence has a name: the `dual-rail qubit\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_cluster_state>`_, where a two-level system is constructed\nby specifying in which of two possible systems a single particle is located. The\ndifference compared to single-qubit gates is that any values of the parameters $a,\nb,c,d$ give rise to a valid particle-conserving unitary. Take for instance the two-qubit gate\n\n\\begin{align}G(\\theta)=\\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n    0 & \\cos (\\theta/2) & -\\sin (\\theta/2) & 0\\\\\n    0 & \\sin(\\theta/2) & \\cos(\\theta/2) & 0\\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n    \\end{pmatrix}.\\end{align}\n\n\nThis is an example of a `Givens rotation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givens_rotation>`_: a\nrotation in a two-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space. In this case, we are performing a\nGivens rotation in a two-dimensional subspace of the four-dimensional space of two-qubit states.\nThis gate allows us to create superpositions by exchanging the particle\nbetween the two qubits. Such transformations can be interpreted as a **single excitation**,\nwhere we view the exchange from $|10\\rangle$ to $|01\\rangle$ as exciting the electron\nfrom the first to the second qubit.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/givens_rotations/Givens_rotations_1.png\n    :align: center\n    :width: 35%\n\n    A Givens rotation can be used to couple states that differ by a single excitation.\n\nThis gate is implemented in PennyLane as the :class:`~.pennylane.SingleExcitation` operation.\nWe can use it to prepare an equal superposition of three-qubit states with a single particle\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|001\\rangle + |010\\rangle + |100\\rangle)$. We apply two single\nexcitation gates with parameters $\\theta, \\phi$ to the initial state $|100\\rangle$.\nThe excitation gates act on qubits 0,1 and 0,2 respectively. This yields the state\n\n\\begin{align}|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\phi/2)|100\\rangle - \\sin(\\theta/2)|010\\rangle -\n    \\cos(\\theta/2)\\sin(\\phi/2)|001\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nSince the amplitude of $|010\\rangle$ must be $1/\\sqrt{3}$, we conclude that\n$-\\sin(\\theta/2)=1/\\sqrt{3}$. This in turn implies that $\\cos(\\theta/2)=\\sqrt{2/3}$ and\ntherefore $-\\sin(\\phi/2)=1/\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, to prepare an equal superposition state we\nchoose the angles of rotation to be\n\n\\begin{align}\\theta &= - 2 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{3}),\\\\\n    \\phi &= - 2 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{2}).\\end{align}\n\nThis can be implemented in PennyLane as follows:\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import pennylane as qml\nimport numpy as np\n\ndev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3)\n\n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef circuit(x, y):\n    # prepares the reference state |100>\n    qml.BasisState(np.array([1, 0, 0]), wires=[0, 1, 2])\n    # applies the single excitations\n    qml.SingleExcitation(x, wires=[0, 1])\n    qml.SingleExcitation(y, wires=[0, 2])\n    return qml.state()\n\nx = -2 * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(1/3))\ny = -2 * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(1/2))\nprint(circuit(x, y))"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The components of the output state are ordered according to their binary\nrepresentation, so entry 1 is $|001\\rangle$, entry 2 is $|010\\rangle$, and entry 4 is\n$|100\\rangle$, meaning we indeed prepared the desired state.

Instead of thinking of single-qubit gates and CNOTs as the\nbuilding-blocks of quantum circuits, we can be more clever and select two-dimensional subspaces\nspanned by states with an equal number of particles, and use Givens rotations in that subspace\nto construct the circuits. \ud83e\udde0\n\nControlled excitation gates\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSingle-qubit gates and CNOT gates are universal for quantum\ncomputing: they can be used to implement any conceivable quantum computation. If Givens\nrotations are analogous to single-qubit gates, then **controlled** Givens rotations are\nanalogous to two-qubit gates. In universality constructions, the ability to control operations\nbased on the states of other qubits is essential, so for this reason it's natural to study\ncontrolled Givens rotations. The simplest of these are controlled single-excitation gates,\nwhich are three-qubit gates that perform the mapping\n\n\\begin{align}CG(\\theta) |101\\rangle &= \\cos (\\theta/2)|101\\rangle + \\sin (\\theta/2)|110\\rangle,\\\\\n  CG(\\theta) |110\\rangle &= \\cos (\\theta/2)|110\\rangle - \\sin (\\theta/2)|101\\rangle,\\end{align}\n\nwhile leaving all other basis states unchanged. This gate only excites a particle\nfrom the second to third qubit, and vice versa, if the first (control) qubit is in state\n$\\ket{1}$. This is a useful property: as the name suggests, it provides us with better\ncontrol over the transformations we want to apply. Suppose we aim to prepare the state\n\n\\begin{align}|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(\\ket{110000} + \\ket{001100} + \\ket{000011} + \\ket{100100}).\\end{align}\n\nSome inspection is enough to see that the states $\\ket{001100}$ and $\\ket{000011}$\ndiffer by a double excitation from the reference state $\\ket{110000}$. Meanwhile, the state\n$\\ket{100100}$ differs by a single excitation. It is thus tempting to think that applying\ntwo double-excitation gates and a single-excitation gate can be used to prepare the target state.\nIt won't work! Applying the single-excitation gate on qubits 1 and 3 will also lead to an\nundesired contribution for the state $|011000\\rangle$ through a coupling with\n$\\ket{001100}$.
