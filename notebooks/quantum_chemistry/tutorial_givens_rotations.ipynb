Last updated: June\n30, 2021*\n\nIn the book [\\\"Sophie\\'s\nworld\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_World), the young\nprotagonist receives a white envelope containing a letter with an\nintriguing question: \\\"Why is Lego the most ingenious toy in the\nworld?\\\" At first baffled by this curious message, she decides to\nreflect on the question. As told by the book\\'s narrator, she arrives at\na conclusion:\n\n*The best thing about them was that with Lego she could construct any\nkind of object. And then she could separate the blocks and construct\nsomething new. What more could one ask of a toy? Sophie decided that\nLego really could be called the most ingenious toy in the world.*\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/lego-circuit.svg)\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn about the building blocks of quantum\ncircuits for quantum chemistry: Givens rotations. These are operations\nthat can be used to construct any kind of particle-conserving circuit.\nWe discuss single and double excitation gates, which are particular\ntypes of Givens rotations that play an important role in quantum\nchemistry. Notably, controlled single excitation gates are universal for\nparticle-conserving unitaries. You will also learn how to use these\ngates to build arbitrary states of a fixed number of particles.\n\nParticle-conserving unitaries\n-----------------------------\n\nUnderstanding the electronic structure of molecules is arguably the\ncentral problem in quantum chemistry. Quantum computers tackle this\nproblem by using systems of qubits to represent the quantum states of\nthe electrons. One method is to consider a collection of [molecular\norbitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital), which\ncapture the three-dimensional region of space occupied by the electrons.\nEach orbital can be occupied by at most two electrons, each with a\ndifferent spin orientation. In this case we refer to *spin orbitals*\nthat can be occupied by a single electron.\n\nThe state of electrons in a molecule can then be described by specifying\nhow the orbitals are occupied. The [Jordan-Wigner\nrepresentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93Wigner_transformation)\nprovides a convenient way to do this: we associate a qubit with each\nspin orbital and use its states to represent occupied $|1\\rangle$ or\nunoccupied $|0\\rangle$ spin orbitals.\n\nAn $n$-qubit state with [Hamming\nweight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight) $k$, i.e., with\n$k$ qubits in state $|1\\rangle$, represents a state of $k$ electrons in\n$n$ spin orbitals. For example $|1010\\rangle$ is a state of two\nelectrons in two spin orbitals. More generally, superpositions over all\nbasis states with a fixed number of particles are valid states of the\nelectrons in a molecule. These are states such as\n\n$$|\\psi\\rangle = c_1|1100\\rangle + c_2|1010\\rangle + c_3|1001\\rangle + c_4|0110\\rangle +\nc_5|0101\\rangle + c_6|0011\\rangle,$$\n\nfor some coefficients $c_i$.\n\n![States of a system with six spin orbitals and three electrons.\nOrbitals are for illustration; they correspond to carbon dioxide, which\nhas more electrons and\norbitals.](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/orbitals+states.png)\n\nBecause the number of electrons in a molecule is fixed, any\ntransformation must conserve the number of particles. We refer to these\nas **particle-conserving unitaries**. When designing quantum circuits\nand algorithms for quantum chemistry, it is desirable to employ only\nparticle-conserving gates that guarantee that the states of the system\nremain valid. This raises the questions: what are the simplest\nparticle-conserving unitaries? Like Legos, how can they be used to\nconstruct any quantum circuit for quantum chemistry applications?\n\nGivens rotations\n----------------\n\nConsider single-qubit gates. In their most general form, they perform\nthe transformation\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nU|0\\rangle &= a |0\\rangle + b |1\\rangle,\\\\\nU|1\\rangle &= c |1\\rangle + d |0\\rangle,\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere $|a|^2+|b|^2=|c|^2+|d|^2=1$ and $ab^* + cd^*=0$. This gate is\nparticle-conserving only if $b=d=0$, which means that the only\nsingle-qubit gates that preserve particle number are diagonal gates of\nthe form\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nU = \\begin{pmatrix}\ne^{i\\theta} & 0\\\\\n0 & e^{i\\phi}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nOn their own, these gates are not very interesting. They can only be\nused to change the relative phases of states in a superposition; they\ncannot be used to create and control such superpositions. So let\\'s take\na look at two-qubit gates.\n\nBasis states of two qubits can be categorized depending on their number\nof particles.\n\nWe have:\n\n-   $|00\\rangle$ with zero particles,\n-   $|01\\rangle,|10\\rangle$ with one particle, and\n-   $|11\\rangle$ with two particles.\n\nWe can now consider transformations that couple the states\n$|01\\rangle,|10\\rangle$. These are gates of the form\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nU|01\\rangle &= a |01\\rangle + b |10\\rangle\\\\\nU|10\\rangle &= c |10\\rangle + d |01\\rangle.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThis should be familiar: the unitary has the same form as a single-qubit\ngate, except that the states $|01\\rangle, |10\\rangle$ respectively take\nthe place of $|0\\rangle,\n|1\\rangle$. This correspondence has a name: the [dual-rail\nqubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_cluster_state), where a\ntwo-level system is constructed by specifying in which of two possible\nsystems a single particle is located. The difference compared to\nsingle-qubit gates is that any values of the parameters $a,\nb,c,d$ give rise to a valid particle-conserving unitary. Take for\ninstance the two-qubit gate\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nG(\\theta)=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & \\cos (\\theta/2) & -\\sin (\\theta/2) & 0\\\\\n0 & \\sin(\\theta/2) & \\cos(\\theta/2) & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThis is an example of a [Givens\nrotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givens_rotation): a rotation in\na two-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space. In this case, we\nare performing a Givens rotation in a two-dimensional subspace of the\nfour-dimensional space of two-qubit states. This gate allows us to\ncreate superpositions by exchanging the particle between the two qubits.\nSuch transformations can be interpreted as a **single excitation**,\nwhere we view the exchange from $|10\\rangle$ to $|01\\rangle$ as exciting\nthe electron from the first to the second qubit.\n\n![A Givens rotation can be used to couple states that differ by a single\nexcitation.](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/Givens_rotations_1.png)\n\nThis gate is implemented in PennyLane as the\n[pennylane.SingleExcitation](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.SingleExcitation.html#pennylane.SingleExcitation)\noperation. We can use it to prepare an equal superposition of\nthree-qubit states with a single particle\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|001\\rangle + |010\\rangle + |100\\rangle)$. We apply\ntwo single excitation gates with parameters $\\theta, \\phi$ to the\ninitial state $|100\\rangle$. The excitation gates act on qubits 0,1 and\n0,2 respectively. This yields the state\n\n$$|\\psi\\rangle = \\cos(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\phi/2)|100\\rangle - \\sin(\\theta/2)|010\\rangle -\n\\cos(\\theta/2)\\sin(\\phi/2)|001\\rangle.$$\n\nSince the amplitude of $|010\\rangle$ must be $1/\\sqrt{3}$, we conclude\nthat $-\\sin(\\theta/2)=1/\\sqrt{3}$. This in turn implies that\n$\\cos(\\theta/2)=\\sqrt{2/3}$ and therefore $-\\sin(\\phi/2)=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\nThus, to prepare an equal superposition state we choose the angles of\nrotation to be\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta &= - 2 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{3}),\\\\\n\\phi &= - 2 \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{2}).\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThis can be implemented in PennyLane as follows:\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import pennylane as qml\nimport numpy as np\n\ndev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=3)\n\n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef circuit(x, y):\n    # prepares the reference state |100>\n    qml.BasisState(np.array([1, 0, 0]), wires=[0, 1, 2])\n    # applies the single excitations\n    qml.SingleExcitation(x, wires=[0, 1])\n    qml.SingleExcitation(y, wires=[0, 2])\n    return qml.state()\n\nx = -2 * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(1/3))\ny = -2 * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(1/2))\nprint(circuit(x, y))"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The components of the output state are ordered according to their binary\nrepresentation, so entry 1 is $|001\\rangle$, entry 2 is $|010\\rangle$,\nand entry 4 is $|100\\rangle$, meaning we indeed prepared the desired\nstate.

Instead of thinking of single-qubit\ngates and CNOTs as the building-blocks of quantum circuits, we can be\nmore clever and select two-dimensional subspaces spanned by states with\nan equal number of particles, and use Givens rotations in that subspace\nto construct the circuits. \ud83e\udde0\n\nControlled excitation gates\n===========================\n\nSingle-qubit gates and CNOT gates are universal for quantum computing:\nthey can be used to implement any conceivable quantum computation. If\nGivens rotations are analogous to single-qubit gates, then\n**controlled** Givens rotations are analogous to two-qubit gates. In\nuniversality constructions, the ability to control operations based on\nthe states of other qubits is essential, so for this reason it\\'s\nnatural to study controlled Givens rotations. The simplest of these are\ncontrolled single-excitation gates, which are three-qubit gates that\nperform the mapping\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nCG(\\theta) |101\\rangle &= \\cos (\\theta/2)|101\\rangle + \\sin (\\theta/2)|110\\rangle,\\\\\nCG(\\theta) |110\\rangle &= \\cos (\\theta/2)|110\\rangle - \\sin (\\theta/2)|101\\rangle,\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhile leaving all other basis states unchanged. This gate only excites a\nparticle from the second to third qubit, and vice versa, if the first\n(control) qubit is in state $\\ket{1}$. This is a useful property: as the\nname suggests, it provides us with better control over the\ntransformations we want to apply. Suppose we aim to prepare the state\n\n$$|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(\\ket{110000} + \\ket{001100} + \\ket{000011} + \\ket{100100}).$$\n\nSome inspection is enough to see that the states $\\ket{001100}$ and\n$\\ket{000011}$ differ by a double excitation from the reference state\n$\\ket{110000}$.

It is thus tempting to think that applying two\ndouble-excitation gates and a single-excitation gate can be used to\nprepare the target state. It won\\'t work!
