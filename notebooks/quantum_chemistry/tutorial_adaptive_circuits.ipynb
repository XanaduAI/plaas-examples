Last updated: 13 September\n2021*\n\nThe key component of variational quantum algorithms for quantum\nchemistry is the circuit used to prepare electronic ground states of a\nmolecule. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) , is the method of\nchoice for performing such quantum chemistry simulations on quantum\ndevices with few qubits. For a given molecule, the appropriate circuit\ncan be generated by using a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz, for\nexample, the unitary coupled cluster with single and double excitations\n(UCCSD). In this approach, we include all possible single and double\nexcitations of electrons from the occupied spin-orbitals of a reference\nstate to the unoccupied spin-orbitals. This makes the construction of\nthe ansatz straightforward for any given molecule. However, using a\npre-constructed ansatz has the disadvantage of reducing performance in\nfavour of generality: the approach may work well in many cases, but it\nwill not be optimized for a specific problem.\n\nIn practical applications, including all possible excitations usually\nincreases the cost of the simulations without improving the accuracy of\nthe results. This motivates implementing a strategy that allows for\napproximation of the contribution of the excitations and selects only\nthose excitations that are found to be important for the given molecule.\nThis can be done by using adaptive methods to construct a circuit for\neach given problem. Using adaptive circuits helps improve performance at\nthe cost of reducing generality.\n\n![Examples of selecting specific gates to generate adaptive\ncircuits.](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/main.png)\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to **adaptively** build customized\nquantum chemistry circuits. This includes a recipe to adaptively select\ngates that have a significant contribution to the desired state, while\nneglecting those that have a small contribution. You will also learn how\nto use the functionality in PennyLane for leveraging the sparsity of a\nmolecular Hamiltonian to make the computation of the expectation values\neven more efficient. Let\\'s get started!\n\nAdaptive circuits\n-----------------\n\nThe main idea behind building adaptive circuits is to compute the\ngradients with respect to all possible excitation gates and then select\ngates based on the magnitude of the computed gradients.\n\nThere are different ways to make use of the gradient information and\nhere we discuss one of these strategies and apply it to compute the\nground state energy of LiH. This method requires constructing the\nHamiltonian and determining all possible excitations, which we can do\nwith functionality built into PennyLane. But we first need to define the\nmolecular parameters, including atomic symbols and coordinates.
