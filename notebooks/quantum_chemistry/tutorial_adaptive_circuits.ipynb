Posted:  2021. Last updated: 13 September 2021*\n\nThe key component of variational quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry is the circuit used to\nprepare electronic ground states of a molecule. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)\n[#peruzzo2014]_, [#yudong2019]_ is the method of choice for performing such quantum chemistry\nsimulations on quantum devices with few qubits. For a given molecule, the appropriate circuit can\nbe generated by using a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz, for example, the unitary coupled cluster\nwith single and double excitations (UCCSD) [#romero2017]_. In this approach, we include all\npossible single and double excitations of electrons from the occupied spin-orbitals of a reference\nstate to the unoccupied spin-orbitals [#givenstutorial]_. This makes the construction of the ansatz\nstraightforward for any given molecule. However, using a pre-constructed ansatz has the disadvantage\nof reducing performance in favour of generality: the approach may work well in many cases, but it\nwill not be optimized for a specific problem.\n\nIn practical applications, including all possible excitations usually increases the cost of the\nsimulations without improving the accuracy of the results. This motivates implementing a strategy\nthat allows for approximation of the contribution of the excitations and selects only those\nexcitations that are found to be important for the given molecule. This can be done by using\nadaptive methods to construct a circuit for each given problem [#grimsley2019]_. Using adaptive\ncircuits helps improve performance at the cost of reducing generality.\n\n.. figure:: /demonstrations/adaptive_circuits/main.png\n    :width: 75%\n    :align: center\n\n    Examples of selecting specific gates to generate adaptive circuits.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to **adaptively** build customized quantum chemistry circuits.\nThis includes a recipe to adaptively select gates that have a significant contribution to\nthe desired state, while neglecting those that have a small contribution. You will also learn how to\nuse the functionality in PennyLane for leveraging the sparsity of a molecular Hamiltonian to make\nthe computation of the expectation values even more efficient. Let's get started!\n\n## Adaptive circuits\n\nThe main idea behind building adaptive circuits is to compute the gradients with respect to all\npossible excitation gates and then select gates based on the magnitude of the computed gradients.\n\nThere are different ways to make use of the gradient information and here we discuss one of\nthese strategies and apply it to compute the ground state energy of LiH. This method requires constructing the\nHamiltonian and determining all possible excitations, which we can do with functionality built into PennyLane.\nBut we first need to define the molecular parameters, including atomic symbols and coordinates.\nNote that the atomic coordinates are in `Bohr <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius>`_.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import qchem\nfrom pennylane import numpy as np\nimport time\n\nsymbols = [\"Li\", \"H\"]\ngeometry = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.969280527])"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["We now compute the molecular Hamiltonian in the\n`STO-3G <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STO-nG_basis_sets>`_ basis and obtain the electronic\nexcitations.

In this\ntutorial, we followed an adaptive strategy that selects a group of gates based on information\nabout the gradients. This method can be extended such that the gates are selected one at time, or\neven to other more elaborate strategies [#grimsley2019]_.\n\n## References\n\n..
