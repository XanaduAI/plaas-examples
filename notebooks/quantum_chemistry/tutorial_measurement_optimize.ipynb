Posted: 18 Jan 2021. Last updated: 8 Apr 2021.*\n\nThe variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is the OG variational quantum algorithm. Harnessing\nnear-term quantum hardware to solve for the electronic structure of molecules, VQE is *the*\nalgorithm that sparked the variational circuit craze of the last 5 years, and holds great\npromise for showcasing a quantum advantage on near-term quantum hardware. It has also inspired\nother quantum algorithms such as the :doc:`Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)\n</demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro>`.\n\nTo scale VQE beyond the regime of classical computation, however, we need to solve for the\nground state of increasingly larger molecules. A consequence is that the number of\nmeasurements we need to make on the quantum hardware also grows polynomially---a huge bottleneck,\nespecially when quantum hardware access is limited and expensive.\n\nTo mitigate this 'measurement problem', a plethora of recent research dropped over the course of\n2019 and 2020 [#yen2020]_ [#izmaylov2019]_ [#huggins2019]_ [#gokhale2020]_ [#verteletskyi2020]_ ,\nexploring potential strategies to minimize the number of measurements required. In fact, by grouping\ncommuting terms of the Hamiltonian, we can significantly reduce the number of\nmeasurements needed---in some cases, reducing the number of measurements by up to 90%!\n\n.. figure:: /demonstrations/measurement_optimize/grouping.png\n    :width: 90%\n    :align: center\n\nIn this demonstration, we revisit the VQE algorithm, see first-hand how the required number of\nmeasurements scales as molecule size increases, and finally use these measurement optimization\nstrategies to minimize the number of measurements we need to make. These techniques are valuable\nbeyond just VQE, allowing you to add measurement optimization to your toolkit of techniques to\nperform variational algorithms more efficiently.\n\nRevisiting VQE\n--------------\n\nThe study of :doc:`variational quantum algorithms </glossary/variational_circuit>` was spearheaded\nby the introduction of the :doc:`variational quantum eigensolver <tutorial_vqe>` (VQE) algorithm in\n2014 [#peruzzo2014]_. While classical variational techniques have been known for decades to estimate\nthe ground state energy of a molecule, VQE allowed this variational technique to be applied using\nquantum computers. Since then, the field of variational quantum algorithms has evolved\nsignificantly, with larger and more complex models being proposed (such as\n:doc:`quantum neural networks </demos/quantum_neural_net>`, :doc:`QGANs </demos/tutorial_QGAN>`, and\n:doc:`variational classifiers </demos/tutorial_variational_classifier>`). However, quantum chemistry\nremains one of the flagship use-cases for variational quantum algorithms, and VQE the standard-bearer.\n\nPart of the appeal of VQE lies within its simplicity. A circuit ansatz $U(\\theta)$ is chosen\n(typically the Unitary Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles\n(:func:`~pennylane.templates.subroutines.UCCSD`) ansatz), and the qubit representation of the\nmolecular Hamiltonian is computed:\n\n\\begin{align}H = \\sum_i c_i h_i,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $h_i$ are the terms of the Hamiltonian written as a tensor product of Pauli operators or the identity\nacting on wire $n$, $P_n \\in \\{I, \\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z\\}$:\n\n\\begin{align}h_i = \\bigotimes_{n=0}^{N-1} P_n.\\end{align}\n\n(The $h_i$ product of Pauli terms is often referred to as a 'Pauli word' in the literature.) The cost\nfunction of the VQE is then simply the expectation value of this Hamiltonian on the state obtained\nafter running the variational quantum circuit:\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{cost}(\\theta) = \\langle 0 | U(\\theta)^\\dagger H U(\\theta) | 0 \\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nBy using a classical optimizer to *minimize* this quantity, we can estimate\nthe ground state energy of the Hamiltonian $H$:\n\n\\begin{align}H U(\\theta_{min}) |0\\rangle = E_{min} U(\\theta_{min}) |0\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nIn practice, when we are using quantum hardware to compute these expectation values we expand out\nthe Hamiltonian as its summation, resulting in separate expectation values that need to be calculated for each term:\n\n\\begin{align}\\text{cost}(\\theta) = \\langle 0 | U(\\theta)^\\dagger \\left(\\sum_i c_i h_i\\right) U(\\theta) | 0 \\rangle\n                        = \\sum_i c_i \\langle 0 | U(\\theta)^\\dagger h_i U(\\theta) | 0 \\rangle.\\end{align}\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>How do we compute the qubit representation of the molecular Hamiltonian? This is a more\n    complicated story that involves applying a self-consistent field method (such as Hartree-Fock),\n    and then performing a fermionic-to-qubit mapping such as the Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev\n    transformations.\n\n    For more details on this process, check out the :doc:`/demos/tutorial_quantum_chemistry`\n    tutorial.</p></div>\n\nThe measurement problem\n-----------------------\n\nFor small molecules, the VQE algorithm scales and performs exceedingly well.

What does this mean in practice?\n\nIn the realm of variational circuits, we typically want to compute expectation values of an\nobservable on a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$.

But, can we use this to reduce the number of measurements we need to perform in the VQE algorithm?\nTo do so, we must find the answer to two questions:\n\n1. How do we determine which terms of the cost Hamiltonian commute?\n\n2. How do we rotate the circuit into the shared eigenbasis prior to measurement?\n\nThe answers to these questions aren't necessarily easy nor straightforward. Thankfully, there are\nsome recent techniques we can harness to address both.\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Qubit-wise commuting Pauli terms\n--------------------------------\n\nBack when we summarized the VQE algorithm, we saw that each term of the Hamiltonian is generally represented\nas a tensor product of Pauli operators:\n\n\\begin{align}h_i = \\bigotimes_{n=0}^{N-1} P_n.\\end{align}\n\nLuckily, this tensor product structure allows us to take a bit of a shortcut. Rather than consider\n**full commutativity**, we can consider a slightly less strict condition known as **qubit-wise\ncommutativity** (QWC).\n\nTo start with, let's consider single-qubit Pauli operators and the identity. We know that the Pauli operators\ncommute with themselves as well as the identity, but they do *not* commute with\neach other:\n\n\\begin{align}[\\sigma_i, I] = 0, ~~~ [\\sigma_i, \\sigma_i] = 0, ~~~ [\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j] = c \\sigma_k \\delta_{ij}.\\end{align}\n\nNow consider two tensor products of Pauli terms, for example $X\\otimes Y \\otimes I$ and\n$X\\otimes I \\otimes Z$. We say that these two terms are qubit-wise commuting, since, if\nwe compare each subsystem in the tensor product, we see that every one commutes:\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{array}{ | *1c | *1c | *1c | *1c | *1c |}\n      X &\\otimes &Y &\\otimes &I\\\\\n      X &\\otimes &I &\\otimes &Z\n    \\end{array} ~~~~ \\Rightarrow ~~~~ [X, X] = 0, ~~~ [Y, I] = 0, ~~~ [I, Z] = 0.\\end{align}\n\nAs a consequence, both terms must commute:\n\n\\begin{align}[X\\otimes Y \\otimes I, X\\otimes I \\otimes Z] = 0.\\end{align}\n\n.. important::\n\n    Qubit-wise commutativity is a **sufficient** but not **necessary** condition\n    for full commutativity. For example, the two Pauli terms $Y\\otimes Y$ and\n    $X\\otimes X$ are not qubit-wise commuting, but do commute (have a go verifying this!).\n\nOnce we have identified a qubit-wise commuting pair of Pauli terms, it is also straightforward to\nfind the gates to rotate the circuit into the shared eigenbasis.

If we were to go with this solution,\nwe would be able to measure the expectation value of the Hamiltonian using two circuit evaluations.\n\nThis problem---finding the minimum number of complete subgraphs of a graph---is actually quite well\nknown in graph theory, where it is referred to as the `minimum clique cover problem\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_cover>`__ (with 'clique' being another term for a complete subgraph).\n\nUnfortunately, that's where our good fortune ends---the minimum clique cover problem is known to\nbe `NP-hard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness>`__, meaning there is no known (classical)\nsolution to finding the optimum/minimum clique cover in polynomial time.\n\nThankfully, there is a silver lining: we know of polynomial-time algorithms for finding\n*approximate* solutions to the minimum clique cover problem. These heuristic approaches, while\nnot guaranteed to find the optimum solution, scale quadratically with the number of nodes in the\ngraph/terms in the Hamiltonian [#yen2020]_, so work reasonably well in practice.\n\nMany of these heuristic approaches have roots in another graph problem known as `graph\ncolouring <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring>`__; the assignment of colours to\nthe graph's vertices such that no adjacent vertices have the same colour. How is this related\nto the minimum clique cover problem, though? If we take our QWC graph above, and generate the\n`complement graph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph>`__ by drawing edges\nbetween all *non*-adjacent nodes,\n\n.. figure:: /demonstrations/measurement_optimize/graph3.png\n    :width: 100%\n    :align: center\n\nwe see that solving the minimum clique cover problem on the QWC graph is equivalent to solving the\ngraph colouring problem on the complement graph using the minimum possible number of colours.\nWhile there are various different heuristic algorithms, a common one is `greedy colouring\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring#Greedy_coloring>`__; in fact, the open-source graph\npackage `NetworkX even provides a function for greedy colouring\n<https://networkx.org/documentation/stable//reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color.html#networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color>`__,\n``nx.greedy_color``.\n\nLet's give this a go, using NetworkX to solve the minimum clique problem for observable grouping.\nFirst, we'll need to generate the QWC graph (with each node corresponding to a Hamiltonian\nterm, and edges indicating two terms that are QWC).\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import networkx as nx\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\nterms = [\n    qml.PauliZ(0),\n    qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1),\n    qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1) @ qml.PauliZ(2),\n    qml.PauliZ(0) @ qml.PauliZ(1) @ qml.PauliZ(2) @ qml.PauliZ(3),\n    qml.PauliX(2) @ qml.PauliX(3),\n    qml.PauliY(0) @ qml.PauliX(2) @ qml.PauliX(3),\n    qml.PauliY(0) @ qml.PauliY(1) @ qml.PauliX(2) @ qml.PauliX(3)\n]\n\nG = nx.Graph()\n\n# add the terms to the graph\nG.add_nodes_from(terms)\n\n# add QWC edges\nG.add_edges_from([\n    [terms[0], terms[1]],  # Z0 <--> Z0 Z1\n    [terms[0], terms[2]],  # Z0 <--> Z0 Z1 Z2\n    [terms[0], terms[3]],  # Z0 <--> Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3\n    [terms[1], terms[2]],  # Z0 Z1 <--> Z0 Z1 Z2\n    [terms[2], terms[3]],  # Z0 Z1 Z2 <--> Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3\n    [terms[1], terms[3]],  # Z0 Z1 <--> Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3\n    [terms[0], terms[4]],  # Z0 <--> X2 X3\n    [terms[1], terms[4]],  # Z0 Z1 <--> X2 X3\n    [terms[4], terms[5]],  # X2 X3 <--> Y0 X2 X3\n    [terms[4], terms[6]],  # X2 X3 <--> Y0 Y1 X2 X3\n    [terms[5], terms[6]],  # Y0 X2 X3 <--> Y0 Y1 X2 X3\n])\n\n\ndef format_pauli_word(term):\n    \"\"\"Convenience function that nicely formats a PennyLane\n    tensor observable as a Pauli word\"\"\"\n    if isinstance(term, qml.operation.Tensor):\n        return \" \".join([format_pauli_word(t) for t in term.obs])\n\n    return f\"{term.name[-1]}{term.wires.tolist()[0]}\"\n\nplt.margins(x=0.1)\nnx.draw(\n    G,\n    labels={node: format_pauli_word(node) for node in terms},\n    with_labels=True,\n    node_size=500,\n    font_size=8,\n    node_color=\"#9eded1\",\n    edge_color=\"#c1c1c1\"\n)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["We can now generate the complement graph (compare this to our handdrawn\nversion above!):\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["C = nx.complement(G)\ncoords = nx.spring_layout(C)\n\nnx.draw(\n    C,\n    coords,\n    labels={node: format_pauli_word(node) for node in terms},\n    with_labels=True,\n    node_size=500,\n    font_size=8,\n    node_color=\"#9eded1\",\n    edge_color=\"#c1c1c1\"\n)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Now that we have the complement graph, we can perform a greedy coloring to\ndetermine the minimum number of QWC groups:\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["groups = nx.coloring.greedy_color(C, strategy=\"largest_first\")\n\n# plot the complement graph with the greedy colouring\nnx.draw(\n    C,\n    coords,\n    labels={node: format_pauli_word(node) for node in terms},\n    with_labels=True,\n    node_size=500,\n    font_size=8,\n    node_color=[(\"#9eded1\", \"#aad4f0\")[groups[node]] for node in C],\n    edge_color=\"#c1c1c1\"\n)\n\n\nnum_groups = len(set(groups.values()))\nprint(\"Minimum number of QWC groupings found:\", num_groups)\n\n\nfor i in range(num_groups):\n    print(f\"\\nGroup {i}:\")\n\n    for term, group_id in groups.items():\n        if group_id == i:\n            print(format_pauli_word(term))"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Putting it all together\n-----------------------\n\nSo, we now have a strategy for minimizing the number of measurements we need to perform\nfor our VQE problem:\n\n1.

Instead, there are a multitude of algorithms that could benefit from these\nmeasurement optimization techniques (QAOA being a prime example).\n\nSo the next time you are working on a variational quantum algorithm and the number\nof measurements required begins to explode---stop, take a deep breath \ud83d\ude24, and consider grouping\nand optimizing your measurements.\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["References\n----------\n\n..
