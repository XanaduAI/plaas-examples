Last updated: 8 Apr\n2021.*\n\nThe variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is the OG variational quantum\nalgorithm. Harnessing near-term quantum hardware to solve for the\nelectronic structure of molecules, VQE is *the* algorithm that sparked\nthe variational circuit craze of the last 5 years, and holds great\npromise for showcasing a quantum advantage on near-term quantum\nhardware. It has also inspired other quantum algorithms such as the\n[Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro.html).\n\nTo scale VQE beyond the regime of classical computation, however, we\nneed to solve for the ground state of increasingly larger molecules. A\nconsequence is that the number of measurements we need to make on the\nquantum hardware also grows polynomially\\-\\--a huge bottleneck,\nespecially when quantum hardware access is limited and expensive.\n\nTo mitigate this \\'measurement problem\\', a plethora of recent research\ndropped over the course of 2019 and 2020 , exploring potential\nstrategies to minimize the number of measurements required. In fact, by\ngrouping commuting terms of the Hamiltonian, we can significantly reduce\nthe number of measurements needed\\-\\--in some cases, reducing the number\nof measurements by up to 90%!\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/grouping.png)\n\nIn this demonstration, we revisit the VQE algorithm, see first-hand how\nthe required number of measurements scales as molecule size increases,\nand finally use these measurement optimization strategies to minimize\nthe number of measurements we need to make. These techniques are\nvaluable beyond just VQE, allowing you to add measurement optimization\nto your toolkit of techniques to perform variational algorithms more\nefficiently.\n\nRevisiting VQE\n--------------\n\nThe study of\n[variational quantum algorithms](https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/variational_circuit.html) was spearheaded by the introduction of the\n[variational quantum eigensolver](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe.html) (VQE) algorithm in 2014. While classical variational\ntechniques have been known for decades to estimate the ground state\nenergy of a molecule, VQE allowed this variational technique to be\napplied using quantum computers. Since then, the field of variational\nquantum algorithms has evolved significantly, with larger and more\ncomplex models being proposed (such as\n[quantum neural networks](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/quantum_neural_net.html), [QGANs](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_QGAN.html), and\n[variational classifiers](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier.html)). However, quantum chemistry remains one of the flagship\nuse-cases for variational quantum algorithms, and VQE the\nstandard-bearer.\n\nPart of the appeal of VQE lies within its simplicity. A circuit ansatz\n$U(\\theta)$ is chosen (typically the Unitary Coupled-Cluster Singles and\nDoubles (`UCCSD()`) ansatz), and the qubit representation of the molecular\nHamiltonian is computed:\n\n$$H = \\sum_i c_i h_i,$$\n\nwhere $h_i$ are the terms of the Hamiltonian written as a tensor product\nof Pauli operators or the identity acting on wire $n$,\n$P_n \\in \\{I, \\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z\\}$:\n\n$$h_i = \\bigotimes_{n=0}^{N-1} P_n.$$\n\n(The $h_i$ product of Pauli terms is often referred to as a \\'Pauli\nword\\' in the literature.) The cost function of the VQE is then simply\nthe expectation value of this Hamiltonian on the state obtained after\nrunning the variational quantum circuit:\n\n$$\\text{cost}(\\theta) = \\langle 0 | U(\\theta)^\\dagger H U(\\theta) | 0 \\rangle.$$\n\nBy using a classical optimizer to *minimize* this quantity, we can\nestimate the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian $H$:\n\n$$H U(\\theta_{min}) |0\\rangle = E_{min} U(\\theta_{min}) |0\\rangle.$$\n\nIn practice, when we are using quantum hardware to compute these\nexpectation values we expand out the Hamiltonian as its summation,\nresulting in separate expectation values that need to be calculated for\neach term:\n\n$$\\text{cost}(\\theta) = \\langle 0 | U(\\theta)^\\dagger \\left(\\sum_i c_i h_i\\right) U(\\theta) | 0 \\rangle\n                    = \\sum_i c_i \\langle 0 | U(\\theta)^\\dagger h_i U(\\theta) | 0 \\rangle.$$\n\n> **Note**\n> \n> How do we compute the qubit representation of the molecular Hamiltonian?\n> This is a more complicated story that involves applying a\n> self-consistent field method (such as Hartree-Fock), and then performing\n> a fermionic-to-qubit mapping such as the Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev\n> transformations.\n> \n> For more details on this process, check out the\n> [tutorial_quantum_chemistry](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_chemistry.html)\n> tutorial.\n\n\n\nThe measurement problem\n-----------------------\n\nFor small molecules, the VQE algorithm scales and performs exceedingly\nwell.

What does this mean in practice?\n\nIn the realm of variational circuits, we typically want to compute\nexpectation values of an observable on a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$.

But, can we use this to reduce the number of measurements we\nneed to perform in the VQE algorithm? To do so, we must find the answer\nto two questions:\n\n1.  How do we determine which terms of the cost Hamiltonian commute?\n2.  How do we rotate the circuit into the shared eigenbasis prior to\n    measurement?\n\nThe answers to these questions aren\\'t necessarily easy nor\nstraightforward.

Rather than consider **full commutativity**, we can consider a\nslightly less strict condition known as **qubit-wise commutativity**\n(QWC).\n\nTo start with, let\\'s consider single-qubit Pauli operators and the\nidentity. We know that the Pauli operators commute with themselves as\nwell as the identity, but they do *not* commute with each other:\n\n$$[\\sigma_i, I] = 0, ~~~ [\\sigma_i, \\sigma_i] = 0, ~~~ [\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j] = c \\sigma_k \\delta_{ij}.$$\n\nNow consider two tensor products of Pauli terms, for example\n$X\\otimes Y \\otimes I$ and $X\\otimes I \\otimes Z$.

These heuristic approaches, while not guaranteed to find\nthe optimum solution, scale quadratically with the number of nodes in\nthe graph/terms in the Hamiltonian, so work reasonably well in practice.\n\nMany of these heuristic approaches have roots in another graph problem\nknown as [graph\ncolouring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring); the assignment\nof colours to the graph\\'s vertices such that no adjacent vertices have\nthe same colour.

If we take our QWC graph above, and generate the\n[complement graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph) by\ndrawing edges between all *non*-adjacent nodes,\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/graph3.png)\n\nwe see that solving the minimum clique cover problem on the QWC graph is\nequivalent to solving the graph colouring problem on the complement\ngraph using the minimum possible number of colours. While there are\nvarious different heuristic algorithms, a common one is [greedy\ncolouring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring#Greedy_coloring);\nin fact, the open-source graph package [NetworkX even provides a\nfunction for greedy\ncolouring](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable//reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color.html#networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color),\n`nx.greedy_color`.\n\nLet\\'s give this a go, using NetworkX to solve the minimum clique\nproblem for observable grouping.
