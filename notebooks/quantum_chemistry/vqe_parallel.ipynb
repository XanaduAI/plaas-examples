Last updated: 13 Dec 2021.*\n\nThis tutorial showcases how using asynchronously-evaluated parallel QPUs can speed up the\ncalculation of the potential energy surface of molecular hydrogen ($H_2$).\n\nUsing a VQE setup, we task two devices from the\n`PennyLane-Forest <https://pennylane-forest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ plugin with evaluating\nseparate terms in the qubit Hamiltonian of $H_2$. As these devices are allowed to operate\nasynchronously, i.e., at the same time and without having to wait for each other,\nthe calculation can be performed in roughly half the time.\n\nWe begin by importing the prerequisite libraries:\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import time\nimport dask\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pennylane import numpy as np\nimport pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import qchem"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["This tutorial requires the ``pennylane-forest`` and ``dask``\npackages, which are installed separately using:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   pip install pennylane-forest\n   pip install \"dask[delayed]\"\n\n## Finding the qubit Hamiltonians of $H_{2}$\n\nThe objective of this tutorial is to evaluate the potential energy surface of molecular\nhydrogen. This is achieved by finding the ground state energy of $H_{2}$ as we increase\nthe bond length between the hydrogen atoms.\n\nEach inter-atomic distance results in a different qubit Hamiltonian. To find the corresponding\nHamiltonian, we use the :func:`~.pennylane.qchem.molecular_hamiltonian` function of the\n:mod:`~.pennylane.qchem` package. Further details on the mapping from the electronic\nHamiltonian of a molecule to a qubit Hamiltonian can be found in the\n:doc:`tutorial_quantum_chemistry` and :doc:`tutorial_vqe`\ntutorials.\n\nWe begin by creating a dictionary containing a selection of bond lengths and corresponding data\nfiles saved in `XYZ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format>`__ format.
