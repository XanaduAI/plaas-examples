Posted: 9 May 2022. Last updated: 9 May 2022*\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to use PennyLane's differentiable Hartree-Fock solver\n[#arrazola2021]_. The quantum chemistry module in PennyLane, :mod:`qml.qchem  <pennylane.qchem>`,\nprovides built-in methods for constructing\natomic and molecular orbitals, building Fock matrices and solving the self-consistent field\nequations to obtain optimized orbitals which can be used to construct fully-differentiable\nmolecular Hamiltonians. PennyLane allows users to natively compute derivatives of all these objects\nwith respect to the underlying parameters using the methods of\n`automatic differentiation <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/automatic_differentiation.html>`_. We\nintroduce a workflow to jointly optimize circuit parameters, nuclear coordinates and basis set\nparameters in a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. You will also learn how to visualize the\natomic and molecular orbitals which can be used to create an animation like this:\n\n.. figure:: /demonstrations/differentiable_HF/h2.gif\n    :width: 60%\n    :align: center\n\n    The bonding molecular orbital of hydrogen visualized during a full geometry, circuit and\n    basis set optimization.\n\nLet's get started!\n\n## Differentiable Hamiltonians\n\nVariational quantum algorithms aim to calculate the energy of a molecule by constructing a\nparameterized quantum circuit and finding a set of parameters that minimize the expectation value of\nthe electronic `molecular Hamiltonian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_Hamiltonian>`_. The\noptimization can be carried out by computing the gradients of the expectation value with respect to\nthese parameters and iteratively updating them until convergence is achieved. In principle, the\noptimization process is not limited to the circuit parameters and can be extended to include the\nparameters of the Hamiltonian that can be optimized concurrently with the circuit parameters. The\naim is now to obtain the set of parameters that minimize the following expectation value\n\n\\begin{align}\\left \\langle \\Psi(\\theta) | H(\\beta) | \\Psi(\\theta) \\right \\rangle,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\theta$ and $\\beta$ represent the circuit and Hamiltonian parameters,\nrespectively.\n\nComputing the gradient of a molecular Hamiltonian is challenging because the dependency of the\nHamiltonian on the molecular parameters is typically not very straightforward. This makes symbolic\ndifferentiation methods, which obtain derivatives of an input function by direct mathematical\nmanipulation, of limited scope. Furthermore, numerical differentiation methods based on\n`finite differences <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method>`_ are not always\nreliable due to their intrinsic instability, especially when the number of\ndifferentiable parameters is large. These limitations can be alleviated by using automatic\ndifferentiation methods which can be used to compute exact gradients of a function, implemented with\ncomputer code, using resources comparable to those required to evaluate the function itself.\n\nEfficient optimization of the molecular Hamiltonian parameters in a variational quantum algorithm\nis essential for tackling problems such as\n`geometry optimization <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_mol_geo_opt.html>`_ and vibrational\nfrequency\ncalculations. These problems require computing the first- and second-order derivatives of the\nmolecular energy with respect to nuclear coordinates which can be efficiently obtained if the\nvariational workflow is automatically differentiable. Another important example is the simultaneous\noptimization of the parameters of the basis set used to construct the atomic orbitals which can in\nprinciple increase the accuracy of the computed energy without increasing the number of qubits in a\nquantum simulation. The joint optimization of the circuit and Hamiltonian parameters can also be\nused when the chemical problem involves optimizing the parameters of external potentials.\n\n## The Hartree-Fock method\n\nThe main goal of the Hartree-Fock method is to obtain molecular orbitals that minimize the\nenergy of a system where electrons are treated as independent particles that experience a mean field\ngenerated by the other electrons. These optimized molecular orbitals are then used to\nconstruct one- and two-body electron integrals in the basis of molecular orbitals, $\\phi$,\n\n\\begin{align}h_{pq} =\\int dx \\,\\phi_p^*(x)\\left(-\\frac{\\nabla^2}{2}-\\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{Z_i}{|r-R_i|}\\right)\\phi_q(x),\\\\\\\\\\end{align}\n\\begin{align}h_{pqrs} = \\int dx_1 dx_2\\, \\frac{\\phi_p^*(x_1)\\phi_q^*(x_2)\\phi_r(x_2)\\phi_s(x_1)}{|r_1-r_2|}.\\end{align}\n\nThese integrals are used to generate a differentiable\n`second-quantized <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_quantization>`_ molecular Hamiltonian as\n\n\n\\begin{align}H=\\sum_{pq} h_{pq}a_p^\\dagger a_q +\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{pqrs}h_{pqrs}a_p^\\dagger a_q^\\dagger a_r a_s,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $a^\\dagger$ and $a$ are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators,\nrespectively. This Hamiltonian is then transformed to the qubit basis. Let's see how this can be\ndone in PennyLane.\n\nTo get started, we need to define the atomic symbols and the nuclear coordinates of the molecule.\nFor the hydrogen molecule we have\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from autograd import grad\nimport pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=5)\n\nsymbols = [\"H\", \"H\"]\n# optimized geometry at the Hartree-Fock level\ngeometry = np.array([[-0.672943567415407, 0.0, 0.0],\n                     [ 0.672943567415407, 0.0, 0.0]], requires_grad=True)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The use of ``requires_grad=True`` specifies that the nuclear coordinates are differentiable\nparameters.

This feature provides two\nmajor benefits: i) All gradient computations needed for parameter optimization can be carried out\nwith the elegant methods of automatic differentiation which facilitates simultaneous optimizations\nof circuit and Hamiltonian parameters in applications such as VQE molecular geometry\noptimizations. ii) By optimizing the molecular parameters such as the exponent and contraction\ncoefficients of Gaussian functions of the basis set, one can reach a lower energy without\nincreasing the number of basis functions. Can you think of other interesting molecular parameters\nthat can be optimized along with the nuclear coordinates and basis set parameters that we\noptimized in this tutorial?\n\n## References\n\n..
