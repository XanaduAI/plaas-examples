Posted: 9 May 2022. Last updated: 9 May 2022*\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to use PennyLane\\'s differentiable\nHartree-Fock solver . The quantum chemistry module in PennyLane,\n`qml.qchem `, provides\nbuilt-in methods for constructing atomic and molecular orbitals,\nbuilding Fock matrices and solving the self-consistent field equations\nto obtain optimized orbitals which can be used to construct\nfully-differentiable molecular Hamiltonians. PennyLane allows users to\nnatively compute derivatives of all these objects with respect to the\nunderlying parameters using the methods of [automatic\ndifferentiation](https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/automatic_differentiation.html).\nWe introduce a workflow to jointly optimize circuit parameters, nuclear\ncoordinates and basis set parameters in a variational quantum\neigensolver algorithm. You will also learn how to visualize the atomic\nand molecular orbitals which can be used to create an animation like\nthis:\n\n![The bonding molecular orbital of hydrogen visualized during a full\ngeometry, circuit and basis set\noptimization.](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/h2.gif)\n\nLet\\'s get started!\n\nDifferentiable Hamiltonians\n---------------------------\n\nVariational quantum algorithms aim to calculate the energy of a molecule\nby constructing a parameterized quantum circuit and finding a set of\nparameters that minimize the expectation value of the electronic\n[molecular\nHamiltonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_Hamiltonian). The\noptimization can be carried out by computing the gradients of the\nexpectation value with respect to these parameters and iteratively\nupdating them until convergence is achieved. In principle, the\noptimization process is not limited to the circuit parameters and can be\nextended to include the parameters of the Hamiltonian that can be\noptimized concurrently with the circuit parameters. The aim is now to\nobtain the set of parameters that minimize the following expectation\nvalue\n\n$$\\left \\langle \\Psi(\\theta) | H(\\beta) | \\Psi(\\theta) \\right \\rangle,$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ and $\\beta$ represent the circuit and Hamiltonian\nparameters, respectively.\n\nComputing the gradient of a molecular Hamiltonian is challenging because\nthe dependency of the Hamiltonian on the molecular parameters is\ntypically not very straightforward. This makes symbolic differentiation\nmethods, which obtain derivatives of an input function by direct\nmathematical manipulation, of limited scope. Furthermore, numerical\ndifferentiation methods based on [finite\ndifferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method) are\nnot always reliable due to their intrinsic instability, especially when\nthe number of differentiable parameters is large. These limitations can\nbe alleviated by using automatic differentiation methods which can be\nused to compute exact gradients of a function, implemented with computer\ncode, using resources comparable to those required to evaluate the\nfunction itself.\n\nEfficient optimization of the molecular Hamiltonian parameters in a\nvariational quantum algorithm is essential for tackling problems such as\n[geometry\noptimization](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_mol_geo_opt.html)\nand vibrational frequency calculations. These problems require computing\nthe first- and second-order derivatives of the molecular energy with\nrespect to nuclear coordinates which can be efficiently obtained if the\nvariational workflow is automatically differentiable. Another important\nexample is the simultaneous optimization of the parameters of the basis\nset used to construct the atomic orbitals which can in principle\nincrease the accuracy of the computed energy without increasing the\nnumber of qubits in a quantum simulation. The joint optimization of the\ncircuit and Hamiltonian parameters can also be used when the chemical\nproblem involves optimizing the parameters of external potentials.\n\nThe Hartree-Fock method\n-----------------------\n\nThe main goal of the Hartree-Fock method is to obtain molecular orbitals\nthat minimize the energy of a system where electrons are treated as\nindependent particles that experience a mean field generated by the\nother electrons. These optimized molecular orbitals are then used to\nconstruct one- and two-body electron integrals in the basis of molecular\norbitals, $\\phi$,\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nh_{pq} =\\int dx \\,\\phi_p^*(x)\\left(-\\frac{\\nabla^2}{2}-\\sum_{i=1}^N\\frac{Z_i}{|r-R_i|}\\right)\\phi_q(x),\\\\\\\\\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n$$h_{pqrs} = \\int dx_1 dx_2\\, \\frac{\\phi_p^*(x_1)\\phi_q^*(x_2)\\phi_r(x_2)\\phi_s(x_1)}{|r_1-r_2|}.$$\n\nThese integrals are used to generate a differentiable\n[second-quantized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_quantization)\nmolecular Hamiltonian as\n\n$$H=\\sum_{pq} h_{pq}a_p^\\dagger a_q +\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{pqrs}h_{pqrs}a_p^\\dagger a_q^\\dagger a_r a_s,$$\n\nwhere $a^\\dagger$ and $a$ are the fermionic creation and annihilation\noperators, respectively. This Hamiltonian is then transformed to the\nqubit basis. Let\\'s see how this can be done in PennyLane.\n\nTo get started, we need to define the atomic symbols and the nuclear\ncoordinates of the molecule.

Can you\nthink of other interesting molecular parameters that can be optimized\nalong with the nuclear coordinates and basis set parameters that we\noptimized in this tutorial?\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nAbout the author \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\--\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["\n"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "PennyLane", "language": "python", "name": "pennylane"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.9.10"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 0}
