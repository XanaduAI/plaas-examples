You will learn how to use time evolution to establish a\nconnection between Hamiltonians and quantum circuits, and how to layer\nthese circuits to create more powerful algorithms. These simple ingredients,\ntogether with the ability to optimize quantum circuits, are the building blocks of QAOA. By focusing\non the fundamentals, PennyLane provides general and flexible capabilities that can be tailored and\nrefined to implement QAOA for a wide variety of problems. In the last part of the tutorial, you will\nlearn how to bring these pieces together and deploy a complete QAOA workflow to solve the\nminimum vertex cover problem. Let's get started! \ud83c\udf89\n\n## Circuits and Hamiltonians\n\nWhen considering quantum circuits, it is often convenient to define them by a\nseries of quantum gates. But there are many instances where\nit is useful to think of a quantum circuit in terms of a\n`Hamiltonian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)>`__.\nIndeed, gates are physically implemented by performing time evolution under a carefully engineered\nHamiltonian. These transformations are described by the time evolution operator,\nwhich is a unitary defined as:\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["\\begin{align}U(H, \\ t) \\ = \\ e^{-i H t / \\hbar}.\\end{align}\n\nThe time evolution operator is determined completely in terms of a Hamiltonian\n$H$ and a scalar $t$ representing time. In fact, any unitary\n$U$ can be written in the form $e^{i \\gamma H}$, where $\\gamma$ is a scalar\nand $H$ is a Hermitian operator,\ninterpreted as a Hamiltonian. Thus, time evolution establishes a connection that allows us to\ndescribe quantum circuits in terms of Hamiltonians. \ud83e\udd2f\n\nIn general, implementing a quantum circuit that exactly exponentiates a Hamiltonian\nwith many non-commuting terms, i.e., a Hamiltonian of the form:\n\n\\begin{align}H \\ = \\ H_1 \\ + \\ H_2 \\ + \\ H_3 \\ + \\ \\cdots \\ + \\ H_N,\\end{align}\n\nis very challenging.
