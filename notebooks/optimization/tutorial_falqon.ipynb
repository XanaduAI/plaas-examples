Then, we use some procedure to drive\nan initial state into the ground state of $H_c$.\nFALQON falls under this broad scheme.\n\nConsider a quantum system governed by a Hamiltonian of the form $H = H_c + \\beta(t) H_d$. These kinds of\nHamiltonians appear often in the theory of `quantum control <https://quantiki.org/wiki/quantum-control-theory>`__, a\nfield of inquiry which studies how a quantum system can be driven from one state to another.\nThe choice of $\\beta(t)$ corresponds to a \"driving strategy\", which partially determines how the system evolves\nwith time.\n\nSuppose our objective is to drive some quantum system\nto the ground state of $H_c$. It is a reasonable goal to\nconstruct a quantum control process such that the energy expectation $\\langle H_c \\rangle_t$ decreases with time:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle H_c\\rangle_t = \\frac{d}{dt} \\langle \\psi(t)|H_c|\\psi(t)\\rangle = i \\beta(t)\\langle [H_d, H_c] \\rangle_t \\leq 0,\\end{align}\n\nwhere the product rule and\n`the Schr\u00f6dinger equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#Time-dependent_equation>`__ are used to derive the above formula.\nIf we pick $\\beta(t) = -\\langle i[H_d, H_c] \\rangle_t,$ so that\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle H_c\\rangle_t = -|\\langle i[H_d, H_c] \\rangle_t|^2 \\leq 0,\\end{align}\n\nthen $\\langle H_c \\rangle$ is guaranteed to strictly decrease, as desired!\nThus, if we evolve some initial state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ under the time evolution operator $U$ corresponding to $H$,\n\n\\begin{align}U(T) = \\mathcal{T} \\exp \\Big[ -i \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{T} H(t) \\ dt \\Big] \\approx \\mathcal{T} \\exp \\Big[ -i \\displaystyle\\sum_{k = 0}^{T/\\Delta t} H( k \\Delta t) \\Delta t \\Big],\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{T}$ is the `time-ordering operator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path-ordering#Time_ordering>`__ and $\\Delta t$ is some small time step,\nthen the energy expectation will strictly decrease, for a large enough value of $T$. This is exactly the procedure used by FALQON to minimize $\\langle H_c \\rangle$.\nIn general, implementing a time evolution unitary in a quantum circuit is\ndifficult, so we use a\n`Trotter-Suzuki decomposition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-evolving_block_decimation#The_Suzuki%E2%80%93Trotter_expansion>`__\nto perform approximate time evolution. We then have\n\n\\begin{align}U(T) \\approx \\mathcal{T} \\exp \\Big[ -i \\displaystyle\\sum_{k = 0}^{T/\\Delta t} H( k \\Delta t) \\Delta t \\Big] \\approx\n            e^{-i\\beta_n H_d \\Delta t} e^{-iH_c \\Delta t} \\cdots e^{-i\\beta_1 H_d \\Delta t} e^{-iH_c \\Delta t} = U_d(\\beta_n) U_c \\cdots U_d(\\beta_1) U_c,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $n = T/\\Delta t$ and $\\beta_k = \\beta(k\\Delta t)$.\nFor each layer of the time evolution, the value $\\beta_k$ is required. However,\n$\\beta_k$ is dependent on the state of the system at some time. Recall that\n\n\\begin{align}\\beta(t) = - \\langle \\psi(t) | i [H_d, H_c] | \\psi(t) \\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nWe let $A(t) := i\\langle [H_d, H_c] \\rangle_t$. Our strategy is to obtain the values\n$\\beta_k$ recursively, by finding the value of $A(t)$ for the **previous time step**. We then set\n\n\\begin{align}\\beta_{k+1} = -A_k = -A(k\\Delta t).\\end{align}\n\nThis leads to the FALQON algorithm as a recursive process. On step $k$, we perform the following three substeps:\n\n1. Prepare the state $|\\psi_k\\rangle = U_d(\\beta_k) U_c \\cdots U_d(\\beta_1) U_c|\\psi_0\\rangle$.\n2. Measure the expectation value $A_k = \\langle i[H_c, H_d]\\rangle_{k \\Delta t}$.\n3. Set $\\beta_{k+1} = -A_k$.\n\nWe repeat for all $k$ from $1$ to $n$, where $n$ is a hyperparameter.\nAt the final step we evaluate $\\langle H_c \\rangle$,\nwhich gives us an approximation for the ground state of $H_c$.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/falqon/falqon.png\n     :align: center\n     :width: 80%\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Simulating FALQON with PennyLane\n--------------------------------\nTo begin, we import the necessary dependencies:\n\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom pennylane import qaoa as qaoa\nimport networkx as nx"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["In this demonstration, we will be using FALQON to solve the\n`maximum clique (MaxClique) problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem>`__: finding the\nlargest complete subgraph of some graph $G$.

The benchmarking data also shows\nhow the reduction in cost slows with each layer, and the additional burden of correctly tuning the time step.

Both\ninvolve alternating layers of time evolution operators corresponding to a cost and a mixer/driver Hamiltonian.\nThe FALQON paper raises the idea of combining FALQON and QAOA to yield a new optimization algorithm that\nleverages the benefits of both. In this final section of the tutorial, we will implement this procedure in PennyLane.\n\nSuppose we want to run a QAOA circuit of depth $p$. Our ansatz will be of the form\n\n\\begin{align}U_{\\text{QAOA}} = e^{-i \\alpha_p H_m} e^{-i \\gamma_p H_c} \\cdots e^{-i \\alpha_1 H_m} e^{-i \\gamma_1 H_c},\\end{align}\n\nfor sets of parameters $\\{\\alpha_k\\}$ and $\\{\\gamma_k\\}$, which are optimized.\nIf we run FALQON for $p$ steps, setting $H_d = H_m$, and use the same cost Hamiltonian, we will end up with\nthe following ansatz:\n\n\\begin{align}U_{\\text{FALQON}} = e^{-i \\Delta t \\beta_p H_m} e^{-i \\Delta t H_c} \\cdots e^{-i \\Delta t \\beta_1 H_m} e^{-i \\Delta t H_c}.\\end{align}\n\nThus, our strategy is to initialize our QAOA parameters using the $\\beta_k$ values that FALQON yields.\nMore specifically, we set $\\alpha_k = \\Delta t \\beta_k$ and $\\gamma_k = \\Delta t$. We then optimize\nover these parameters. The goal is that these parameters provide QAOA a good place in the parameter space to\nbegin its optimization.\n\nUsing the code from earlier in the demonstration, we can easily prototype this process.
