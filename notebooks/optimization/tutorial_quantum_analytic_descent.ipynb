Posted: 30 June 2021.*\n\nOne of the main problems of many-body physics is that of finding the ground\nstate and ground state energy of a given Hamiltonian.\n`The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe.html>`_ combines smart circuit\ndesign with gradient-based optimization to solve this task.\nSeveral practical demonstrations have shown how near-term quantum\ndevices may be suitable for VQE and other variational quantum algorithms.\nOne issue for such an approach, though, is that the optimization landscape is\nnon-convex, so reaching a good enough local minimum quickly requires hundreds or\nthousands of update steps. This is problematic because computing gradients of the\ncost function on a quantum computer is inefficient when it comes to circuits\nwith many parameters.\n\nAt the same time, we have a good understanding of the *local* shape\nof the cost landscape around any reference point.\nCashing in on this, the authors of the\nQuantum Analytic Descent paper [#QAD]_\npropose an algorithm that constructs a classical model which approximates the\nlandscape, so that the gradients can be calculated on a classical computer, which is much cheaper.\nIn order to build the classical model, we need to use the quantum device to\nevaluate the cost function on (a) a reference point $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$,\nand (b) a number of points shifted away from $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$.\nWith the cost values at these points, we can build the classical model that\napproximates the landscape.\n\nIn this demo, you will learn how to implement Quantum Analytic Descent using PennyLane.\nIn addition, you will look under the hood of the constructed models and the optimization steps\ncarried out by the algorithm.\nSo: sit down, relax, and enjoy your optimization!\n\n|\n\n.. figure::

rise to trigonometric cost functions\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWhen we talk about VQEs we have a quantum circuit with $n$ qubits in mind, which are typically initialized in the base state $|0\\rangle$.\nThe body of the circuit is a *variational form* $V(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ -- a fixed architecture of quantum gates parametrized by an array of real-valued parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$.\nAfter the variational form, the circuit ends with the measurement of a chosen observable\n$\\mathcal{M}$, based on the problem\nwe are trying to solve.\n\nThe idea in VQE is to fix a variational form such that the expected value of the measurement relates to the energy of an interesting Hamiltonian:\n\n\\begin{align}E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\langle 0|V^\\dagger(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\mathcal{M}V(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})|0\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nWe want to find the lowest possible energy the system can attain;\nthis corresponds to running an optimization program to find the $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ that minimizes the function above.\n\n\nIf the gates in the variational form are restricted to be Pauli rotations, then the cost function is a sum of *multilinear trigonometric terms* in each of the parameters.\nThat's a scary sequence of words!\nWhat it means is that if we look at $E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ but we focus only on one of the parameters, say $\\theta_i$, then we can write the functional dependence as a linear combination of three functions: $1$, $\\sin(\\theta_i)$, and $\\cos(\\theta_i)$.\nThat is, for each parameter $\\theta_i$ there exist $a_i$, $b_i$, and $c_i$ such that the cost can be written as\n\n\\begin{align}E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = a_i + b_i\\sin(\\theta_i) + c_i\\cos(\\theta_i).\\end{align}\n\nAll parameters but $\\theta_i$ are absorbed in the coefficients $a_i$, $b_i$ and $c_i$.\nAnother technique using this structure of $E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ are the\nRotosolve/Rotoselect algorithms [#Rotosolve]_ for which there also is `a PennyLane demo <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_rotoselect.html>`__.\n\nLet's look at a toy example to illustrate

far is:\n*if the variational parameters feed into Pauli rotations, the energy landscape is a multilinear combination of trigonometric functions*.\nWhat is a good thing about trigonometric functions?\nThat's right!\nWe have studied them since high school and know how their graphs look.\n\nThe QAD strategy\n----------------\n\nBy now we know how the energy landscape looks for a small example.\nScaling this up to more parameters would quickly become unfeasible because we need to query a quantum computer for every combination of parameter values.\nThe secret ingredient of this sauce is that we only need to build an approximate classical model.\nUsing an approximate classical model has one feature and one bug.\nThe feature: it is cheap to construct.\nThe bug: well, it's only approximate, so we cannot rely on it fully.\nAnd one extra feature (you didn't see that coming, did you?): if the reference point about which we build the classical model is a true local minimum, then it will be a local minimum of the classical model too.\nAnd that is the key!\nGiven a reference point, we use the classical model to find a point that's closer to the true minimum, and then use that point as reference for a new model!\nThis is what is called Quantum Analytic Descent (QAD), and if you are fine not knowing yet what all the symbols mean, here's its pseudo-algorithm:\n\n#. Set an initial reference point $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$.\n#. Build the model $\\hat{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\approx E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0+\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ at this point.\n#. Find the minimum $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_\\text{min}$ of the model.\n#. Set $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0+\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_\\text{min}$ as the new reference point $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$, go back to Step 2.\n#. After convergence or a fixed number of models built, output the last minimum $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_\\text{opt}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0+\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_\\text{min}$.\n\nComputing a classical model\n---------------------------\n\nKnowing how the cost looks when restricted to only one parameter (see the plot above), nothing keeps us in theory from constructing a perfect classical model.\nThe only thing we need to do is write down a general multilinear trigonometric polynomial and determine its coefficients.\nSimple, right?\nWell, for $m$ parameters, there would be $3^m$ coefficients to estimate, which gives us the ever-dreaded exponential scaling.\nAlthough conceptually simple, building an exact model would require exponentially many resources, and that's a no-go.\nWhat can we do, then?\nThe authors of QAD propose building an imperfect model.\nThis makes *all* the difference---they use a classical model that is accurate only in\na region close to a given reference point, and that delivers good results for the optimization!\n\nFunction expansions\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhat do we usually do when we want to approximate something in a region near to a reference point?\nCorrect!\nWe use a Taylor expansion!\nBut what if we told you there is a better option for the case at hand?\nIn the QAD paper, the authors state that a *trigonometric expansion* up to second order is already a sound model candidate. Let's recap such expansions.\n\n.. admonition:: Taylor expansion vs. Trigonometric expansion\n\n    In spirit, a trigonometric expansion and a Taylor expansion are not that different: both are linear combinations of some basis functions, where the coefficients of the sum take very specific values usually related to the derivatives of the function we want to approximate.\n    The difference between Taylor's and a trigonometric expansion is mainly what basis of functions we take.\n    In Calculus I we learned that a Taylor series in one variable $x$ uses the integer powers of the variable namely $\\{1, x, x^2, x^3, \\ldots\\}$, in short $\\{x^n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$:\n\n    .. math:: f_\\text{Taylor}(x) = \\sum c_n(x-x_0)^n.\n\n    A trigonometric expansion instead uses a different basis, also for one variable: $\\{1, \\sin(x), \\cos(x), \\sin(2x), \\cos(2x), \\ldots\\}$, which we could call the set of trigonometric monomials with integer frequency, or in short $\\{\\sin(nx),\\cos(nx)\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$:\n\n    .. math:: f_\\text{Trig}(x) = \\sum a_n \\cos(n(x-x_0))+ b_n \\sin(n(x-x_0)).\n\n    For higher-dimensional variables we have to take products of the basis functions of each coordinate, i.e., of monomials or trigonometric monomials respectively.\n    This does lead to an exponentially increasing number of terms, but if we chop the series soon enough it will not get too much out of hand.\n    The proposal here is to only go up to second order terms, so we are safe.\n\nExpanding in adapted trigonometric polynomials\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nOne important aspect in which trigonometric series differ from regular\nexpansions is that there is not a clear separation between what terms\ncontribute to each order of the expansion (due to the fact that all\nderivatives of sine and cosine are non-zero in general).\nBecause of this, we group the terms by their leading order contribution, and\nin the following table write them next to their non-trigonometric analogues.\nAll chosen trigonometric monomials have leading order coefficient $1$\nand they all differ in their leading order contribution.\n\n.. list-table::\n   :widths: 10 70 20\n   :header-rows: 1\n\n   * - Order\n     - Trigonometric monomial\n     - Taylor monomial\n   * - 0\n     - $A(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})= \\prod_{i=1}^m \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta_i}{2}\\right)^2$\n     - $1$\n   * - 1\n     - $B_k(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta_k}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta_k}{2}\\right)\\prod_{i\\neq k} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta_i}{2}\\right)^2$\n     - $x_k$\n   * - 2\n     - $C_k(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta_k}{2}\\right)^2\\prod_{i\\neq k} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta_i}{2}\\right)^2$\n     - $x_k^2$\n   * - 2\n     - $D_{kl}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = 4\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta_k}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta_k}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta_l}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta_l}{2}\\right)\\prod_{i\\neq k,l} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta_i}{2}\\right)^2$\n     - $x_kx_l$\n\nThose are really large terms compared to a Taylor series!\nHowever, you may have noticed all of those terms have large parts in common.\nIndeed, we can rewrite the longer ones in a shorter way which is more decent to look at:\n\n\\begin{align}B_k(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) &= 2\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta_k}{2}\\right)A(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\\\\n  C_k(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) &= 2\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta_k}{2}\\right)^2 A(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\\\\n  D_{kl}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) &= 4\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta_k}{2}\\right)\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta_l}{2}\\right)A(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\end{align}\n\nWith that, we know what type of terms we should expect to encounter in our local classical model:\nthe model we want to construct is a linear combination of the functions\n$A(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, $B_k(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and $C_k(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$\nfor each parameter, and $D_{kl}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ for every pair of different parameters $(\\theta_k,\\theta_l)$.\n\nComputing the expansion coefficients\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWe can now use the derivatives of the function we are approximating to obtain the coefficients of the linear combination.\nAs the terms we include in the expansion have leading orders $0$, $1$ and $2$, these derivatives are\n$E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, $\\partial E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})/\\partial \\theta_k$,\n$\\partial^2 E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})/\\partial\\theta_k^2$, and $\\partial^2 E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})/\\partial \\theta_k\\partial\\theta_l$.\nHowever, the trigonometric polynomials may contain multiple orders in $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. For example, both\n$A(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ and $C_k(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ contribute to the second order, so we have to account\nfor this in the coefficient of $\\partial^2 E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})/\\partial \\theta_k^2$.\nWe can name the different coefficients (including the function value itself) accordingly to how we named the terms in the series:\n\n\\begin{align}E^{(A)} &= E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\Bigg|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=0} \\\\\n  E^{(B)}_k &= \\frac{\\partial E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}{\\partial\\theta_k}\\Bigg|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=0} \\\\\n  E^{(C)}_k &= \\frac{\\partial^2 E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}{\\partial\\theta_k^2}\\Bigg|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=0} + \\frac{1}{2}E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\Bigg|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=0}\\\\\n  E^{(D)}_{kl} &= \\frac{\\partial^2 E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}{\\partial\\theta_k\\partial\\theta_l}\\Bigg|_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=0}\\end{align}\n\nIn PennyLane, computing the gradient of a cost function with respect to an array of parameters can be easily done\nwith the `parameter-shift rule <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/parameter_shift.html>`_.\nBy iterating the rule, we can obtain the second derivatives -- the Hessian (see for example [#higher_order_diff]_).\nLet us implement a function that does just that and prepares the coefficients $E^{(A/B/C/D)}$:\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["def get_model_data(fun, params):\n    \"\"\"Computes the coefficients for the classical model, E^(A), E^(B), E^(C), and E^(D).\"\"\"\n    num_params = len(params)\n\n    #

This is underlined in the third plot, where we see the difference between\nthe model and true landscapes.\nAround the reference point the difference is very small and changes very slowly,\nonly growing significantly for large simultaneous perturbations in both\nparameters. This already hints at the value of the model for local optimization.\n\nQuantum Analytic Descent\n------------------------\n\nThe underlying idea we will now try to exploit for optimization in VQEs is the following:\nif we can model the cost around the reference point well enough, we will be able to find a rough\nestimate of where the minimum of the landscape is.\nGranted, our model represents the true landscape less accurately the further we go away from the\nreference point $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$, but nonetheless the minimum *of the model*\nwill bring us much closer to the minimum *of the true cost* than a random choice.\nRecall the complete strategy from above:\n\n#. Set an initial reference point $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$.\n#. Build the model $\\hat{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\approx E(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0+\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ at this point.\n#. Find the minimum $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_\\text{min}$ of the model.\n#. Set $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0+\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_\\text{min}$ as the new reference point $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$, go back to Step 2.\n#. After convergence or a fixed number of models built, output the last minimum $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_\\text{opt}=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0+\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_\\text{min}$.\n\nThis provides an iterative strategy which will take us to a good enough solution\nin fewer iterations than, for example, regular stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\nThe procedure of Quantum Analytic Descent is also shown in the following flowchart. Note that the minimization\nof the model in Step 3 is carried out via an inner optimization loop.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/quantum_analytic_descent/flowchart.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 80%\n   :target: javascript:void(0)\n\nUsing the functions from above, we now can implement the loop between Steps 2 and 4.\nIndeed, for a relatively small number of iterations we should already find a low enough value.\nIf we look back at the circuit we defined, we notice that we are measuring the observable\n\n.. math ::\n\n  Z\\otimes Z=\\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix},\n\nwhich has the eigenvalues $1$ and $-1$.\nThis means our function is bounded and takes values in the range $[-1,1]$, so that the global minimum should be around $-1$ if our circuit is expressive enough.\nLet's try it and apply the full optimization strategy:\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import copy\n\n# Set the number of iterations of Steps 2, 3, and 4\nN_iter_outer = 3\nN_iter_inner = 50\n\npast_coeffs = []\npast_parameters = []\ncircuit_log = [circuit(parameters)]\nmodel_logs = []\n\nfor iter_outer in range(N_iter_outer):\n    # Model building phase of outer iteration - step 2.\n    coeffs = get_model_data(circuit, parameters)\n    past_coeffs.append(copy.deepcopy(coeffs))\n    past_parameters.append(parameters.copy())\n    # Map the model to be only depending on the parameters, not the coefficients.\n    mapped_model = lambda params: model_cost(params, *coeffs)\n\n    if iter_outer == 0:\n        print(f\"True energy at initial parameters: {np.round(coeffs[0], decimals=4)}\\n\")\n\n    opt = qml.AdamOptimizer(0.05)\n    # Recall that the parameters of the model are relative coordinates.\n    # Correspondingly, we initialize at 0, not at parameters.\n    relative_parameters = np.zeros_like(parameters, requires_grad=True)\n    model_log = [mapped_model(relative_parameters)]\n    print(f\"-Iteration {iter_outer+1}-\")\n\n    # Run the optimizer for N_iter_inner epochs - Step 3.\n    for iter_inner in range(N_iter_inner):\n        relative_parameters = opt.step(mapped_model, relative_parameters)\n        circuit_log.append(circuit(parameters + relative_parameters))\n        model_log.append(mapped_model(relative_parameters))\n        if (iter_inner + 1) % 50 == 0:\n            E_model = mapped_model(relative_parameters)\n            print(\n                f\"Epoch {iter_inner+1:4d}: Model cost = {np.round(E_model, 4)}\",\n                f\" at relative parameters {np.round(relative_parameters, 4)}\",\n            )\n\n    # Store the relative parameters that minimize the model by adding the shift - Step 4.\n    parameters += relative_parameters\n    E_original = circuit(parameters)\n    print(f\"True energy at the minimum of the model: {E_original}\")\n    print(f\"New reference parameters: {np.round(parameters, 4)}\\n\")\n    model_logs.append(model_log)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["This looks great!
