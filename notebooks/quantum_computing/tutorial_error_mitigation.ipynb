Last updated: 29 November 2021*\n\nHave you ever run a circuit on quantum hardware and not quite got the\nresult you were expecting? If so, welcome to the world of noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices! These devices must function\nin noisy environments and are unable to execute quantum circuits\nperfectly, resulting in outputs that can have a significant error. The\nlong-term plan of quantum computing is to develop a subsequent\ngeneration of error-corrected hardware. In the meantime, how can we best\nutilize our error-prone NISQ devices for practical tasks? One proposed\nsolution is to adopt an approach called error *mitigation*, which aims\nto minimize the effects of noise by executing a family of related\ncircuits and using the results to estimate an error-free value.\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/laptop.png)\n\nThis demo shows how error mitigation can be carried out by combining\nPennyLane with the [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq)\npackage, a Python-based library providing a range of error mitigation\ntechniques. Integration with PennyLane is available from the `0.11`\nversion of Mitiq, which can be installed using\n\n``` {.bash}\npip install \"mitiq>=0.11\"\n```\n\nWe\\'ll begin the demo by jumping straight into the deep end and seeing\nhow to mitigate a simple noisy circuit in PennyLane with Mitiq as a\nbackend. After, we\\'ll take a step back and discuss the theory behind\nthe error mitigation approach we used, known as zero-noise\nextrapolation. Using this knowledge, we\\'ll give a more detailed\nexplanation of how error mitigation can be carried out in PennyLane. The\nfinal part of this demo showcases the application of mitigation to\nquantum chemistry, allowing us to more accurately calculate the\npotential energy surface of molecular hydrogen.\n\nMitigating noise in a simple circuit\n------------------------------------\n\nWe first need a noisy device to execute our circuit on. Let\\'s keep\nthings simple for now by loading the\n[default.mixed](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.devices.default_mixed.html#module-pennylane.devices.default_mixed) simulator and artificially adding\n[PhaseDamping](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.PhaseDamping.html#pennylane.PhaseDamping)\nnoise.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import pennylane as qml\n\nn_wires = 4\n\n# Describe noise\nnoise_gate = qml.PhaseDamping\nnoise_strength = 0.1\n\n# Load devices\ndev_ideal = qml.device(\"default.mixed\", wires=n_wires)\ndev_noisy = qml.transforms.insert(noise_gate, noise_strength)(dev_ideal)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["In the above, we load a noise-free device `dev_ideal` and a noisy device\n`dev_noisy`, which is constructed from the\n[qml.transforms.insert](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.transforms.insert.html#pennylane.transforms.insert) transform. This transform works by intercepting each\ncircuit executed on the device and adding the\n[PhaseDamping](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.PhaseDamping.html#pennylane.PhaseDamping)\nnoise channel directly after every gate in the circuit.

Importantly, such a circuit performs an identity\ntransformation $U^{\\dagger} U |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$ to any input\nstate $|\\psi\\rangle$ and we can show that the expected value of an ideal\ncircuit execution with an input state $|0\\rangle$ is\n\n$$\\langle 0 | U U^{\\dagger} Z U^{\\dagger} U | 0 \\rangle = 1.$$\n\nAlthough this circuit seems trivial, it provides an ideal test case for\nbenchmarking noisy devices where we expect the output to be less than\none due to the detrimental effects of noise.

How does this\nwork?\n\nUnderstanding error mitigation\n==============================\n\nError mitigation can be realized through a number of techniques, and the\nMitiq [documentation](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a\ngreat resource to start learning more. In this demo, we focus upon the\nzero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) method originally introduced by Temme et\nal. and Li et al..\n\nThe ZNE method works by assuming that the amount of noise present when a\ncircuit is run on a noisy device is enumerated by a parameter $\\gamma$.\nSuppose we have an input circuit that experiences an amount of noise\n$\\gamma = \\gamma_{0}$ when executed. Ideally, we would like to evaluate\nthe result of the circuit in the $\\gamma = 0$ noise-free setting.\n\nTo do this, we create a family of equivalent circuits whose ideal\nnoise-free value is the same as our input circuit. However, when run on\na noisy device, each circuit experiences an amount of noise\n$\\gamma = s \\gamma_{0}$ for some scale factor $s \\ge 1$. By evaluating\nthe noisy outputs of each circuit, we can extrapolate to $s=0$ to\nestimate the result of running a noise-free circuit.\n\nA key element of ZNE is the ability to run equivalent circuits for a\nrange of scale factors $s$. When the noise present in a circuit scales\nwith the number of gates, $s$ can be varied using unitary folding.\nUnitary folding works by noticing that any unitary $V$ is equivalent to\n$V V^{\\dagger} V$. This type of transform can be applied to individual\ngates in the circuit or to the whole circuit. Let\\'s see how folding\nworks in code using Mitiq\\'s\n[fold\\_global](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#mitiq.zne.scaling.folding.fold_global)\nfunction, which folds globally by setting $V$ to be the whole circuit.\nWe begin by making a copy of our above circuit using a\n[QuantumTape](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.tape.QuantumTape.html#pennylane.tape.QuantumTape), which provides a low-level approach for circuit\nconstruction in PennyLane.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as circuit:\n    template(w1, w2, wires=range(n_wires))\n    qml.adjoint(template)(w1, w2, wires=range(n_wires))"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Don\\'t worry, in most situations you will not need to work with a\nPennyLane [QuantumTape](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.tape.QuantumTape.html#pennylane.tape.QuantumTape)!

This function is an\nexample of a\n[circuit transform,](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/qml_transforms.html) and it can be applied to pre-constructed QNodes as well as\nbeing used as a decorator when constructing new QNodes. For example,\nsuppose we have a `qnode` already defined. A mitigated QNode can be\ncreated using:\n\n``` {.python}\nmitigated_qnode = mitigate_with_zne(scale_factors, folding, extrapolate)(qnode)\n```\n\nWhen using `mitigate_with_zne`, we must specify the target scale factors\nas well as provide functions for folding and extrapolation. Due to\nPennyLane\\'s integration with Mitiq, it is possible to use the folding\nfunctions provided in the\n[mitiq.zne.scaling.folding](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#module-mitiq.zne.scaling.folding)\nmodule. For extrapolation, one can use the `extrapolate` method of the\nfactories in the\n[mitiq.zne.inference](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#module-mitiq.zne.inference)\nmodule.\n\nWe now provide an example of how `mitigate_with_zne` can be used when\nconstructing a QNode:\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from mitiq.zne.scaling import fold_gates_at_random as folding\n\nextrapolate = RichardsonFactory.extrapolate\n\n\n@mitigate_with_zne(scale_factors, folding, extrapolate, reps_per_factor=100)\n@qml.qnode(dev_noisy)\ndef mitigated_qnode(w1, w2):\n    template(w1, w2, wires=range(n_wires))\n    qml.adjoint(template)(w1, w2, wires=range(n_wires))\n    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))\n\n\nmitigated_qnode(w1, w2)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["In the above, we can easily add in error mitigation using the\n`@mitigate_with_zne` decorator.

For example,\nthe\n[execute\\_with\\_zne](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#mitiq.zne.zne.execute_with_zne)\nfunction is one of the central components of ZNE support in Mitiq and is\ncompatible with circuits constructed using a PennyLane\n[QuantumTape](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.tape.QuantumTape.html#pennylane.tape.QuantumTape). Working directly with Mitiq can be preferable when more\nflexibility is required in specifying the error mitigation protocol. For\nexample, the code below shows how an adaptive approach can be used to\ndetermine a sequence of scale factors for extrapolation using Mitiq\\'s\n[AdaExpFactory](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#mitiq.zne.inference.AdaExpFactory).\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from mitiq.zne import execute_with_zne\nfrom mitiq.zne.inference import AdaExpFactory\n\nfactory = AdaExpFactory(steps=20)\n\nexecute_with_zne(circuit, executor, factory=factory, scale_noise=fold_global)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Recall that `circuit` is a PennyLane\n[QuantumTape](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.tape.QuantumTape.html#pennylane.tape.QuantumTape) and that it should not include measurements.

This is achieved by finding the ground state energy of $H_{2}$\nas we increase the bond length between the hydrogen atoms. As shown in\n[this](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_chemical_reactions.html)\ntutorial, one approach to finding the ground state energy is to\ncalculate the corresponding qubit Hamiltonian and to fix an ansatz\nvariational quantum circuit that returns its expectation value. We can\nthen vary the parameters of the circuit to minimize the energy.\n\nTo find the potential energy surface of $H_{2}$, we must choose a range\nof interatomic distances and calculate the qubit Hamiltonian\ncorresponding to each distance. We then optimize the variational circuit\nwith a new set of parameters for each Hamiltonian and plot the resulting\nenergies for each distance.
