Last updated: 29 November 2021*\n\nHave you ever run a circuit on quantum hardware and not quite got the result you were expecting?\nIf so, welcome to the world of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices! These devices must\nfunction in noisy environments and are unable to execute quantum circuits perfectly, resulting in\noutputs that can have a significant error. The long-term plan of quantum computing is to develop a\nsubsequent generation of error-corrected hardware. In the meantime, how can we best utilize our\nerror-prone NISQ devices for practical tasks? One proposed solution is to adopt an approach called\nerror *mitigation*, which aims to minimize the effects of noise by executing a family of related\ncircuits and using the results to estimate an error-free value.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/error_mitigation/laptop.png\n    :align: center\n    :scale: 55%\n    :alt: Mitiq and PennyLane\n    :target: javascript:void(0);\n\nThis demo shows how error mitigation can be carried out by combining PennyLane with the\n`Mitiq <https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq>`__ package, a Python-based library providing a range\nof error mitigation techniques. Integration with PennyLane is available from the ``0.11`` version\nof Mitiq, which can be installed using\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install \"mitiq>=0.11\"\n\nWe'll begin the demo by jumping straight into the deep end and seeing how to mitigate a simple noisy\ncircuit in PennyLane with Mitiq as a backend. After, we'll take a step back and discuss the theory\nbehind the error mitigation approach we used, known as zero-noise extrapolation. Using this\nknowledge, we'll give a more detailed explanation of how error mitigation can be carried out in\nPennyLane. The final part of\nthis demo showcases the application of mitigation to quantum chemistry, allowing us to more\naccurately calculate the potential energy surface of molecular hydrogen.\n\nMitigating noise in a simple circuit\n------------------------------------\n\nWe first need a noisy device to execute our circuit on.

How does this work?\n\nUnderstanding error mitigation\n------------------------------\n\nError mitigation can be realized through a number of techniques, and the Mitiq\n`documentation <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ is a great resource to start learning\nmore. In this demo, we focus upon the zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) method originally\nintroduced by Temme et al. [#temme2017error]_ and Li et al. [#li2017efficient]_.\n\nThe ZNE method works by assuming that the amount of noise present when a circuit is run on a\nnoisy device is enumerated by a parameter $\\gamma$. Suppose we have an input circuit\nthat experiences an amount of noise $\\gamma = \\gamma_{0}$ when executed.\nIdeally, we would like to evaluate the result of the circuit in the $\\gamma = 0$\nnoise-free setting.\n\nTo do this, we create a family of equivalent circuits whose ideal noise-free value is the\nsame as our input circuit. However, when run on a noisy device, each circuit experiences\nan amount of noise $\\gamma = s \\gamma_{0}$ for some scale factor $s \\ge 1$. By\nevaluating the noisy outputs of each circuit, we can extrapolate to $s=0$ to estimate\nthe result of running a noise-free circuit.\n\nA key element of ZNE is the ability to run equivalent circuits for a range of scale factors\n$s$. When the noise present in a circuit scales with the number of gates, $s$\ncan be varied using unitary folding [#giurgica2020digital]_.\nUnitary folding works by noticing that any unitary $V$ is equivalent to\n$V V^{\\dagger} V$. This type of transform can be applied to individual gates in the\ncircuit or to the whole circuit.\nLet's see how\nfolding works in code using Mitiq's\n`fold_global <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#mitiq.zne.scaling.folding.fold_global>`__\nfunction, which folds globally by setting $V$ to be the whole circuit.\nWe begin by making a copy of our above circuit using a\n:class:`QuantumTape <pennylane.tape.QuantumTape>`, which provides a low-level approach for circuit\nconstruction in PennyLane.\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["with qml.tape.QuantumTape() as circuit:\n    template(w1, w2, wires=range(n_wires))\n    qml.adjoint(template)(w1, w2, wires=range(n_wires))"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Don't worry, in most situations you will not need to work with a PennyLane\n:class:`QuantumTape <pennylane.tape.QuantumTape>`!

The final step is to extrapolate our\nresults back to $s=0$, providing us with an estimate of the noise-free result of the\ncircuit.\n\nPerforming extrapolation is a well-studied numeric method in mathematics, and Mitiq provides\naccess to some of the core approaches.

As we have seen, the\n:func:`mitigate_with_zne <pennylane.transforms.mitigate_with_zne>` function provides the main\nentry point. This function is an example of a :doc:`circuit transform, </code/qml_transforms>` and\nit can be applied to pre-constructed QNodes as well as being used as a decorator when constructing\nnew QNodes. For example, suppose we have a ``qnode`` already defined. A mitigated QNode can be\ncreated using:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    mitigated_qnode = mitigate_with_zne(scale_factors, folding, extrapolate)(qnode)\n\nWhen using ``mitigate_with_zne``, we must specify the target scale factors as well as provide\nfunctions for folding and extrapolation. Due to PennyLane's integration with Mitiq, it is possible\nto use the folding functions provided in the\n`mitiq.zne.scaling.folding <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#module-mitiq.zne.scaling.folding>`__\nmodule. For extrapolation, one can use the ``extrapolate`` method of the factories in the\n`mitiq.zne.inference <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#module-mitiq.zne.inference>`__\nmodule.\n\nWe now provide an example of how ``mitigate_with_zne`` can be used when constructing a QNode:\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from mitiq.zne.scaling import fold_gates_at_random as folding\n\nextrapolate = RichardsonFactory.extrapolate\n\n\n@mitigate_with_zne(scale_factors, folding, extrapolate, reps_per_factor=100)\n@qml.qnode(dev_noisy)\ndef mitigated_qnode(w1, w2):\n    template(w1, w2, wires=range(n_wires))\n    qml.adjoint(template)(w1, w2, wires=range(n_wires))\n    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))\n\n\nmitigated_qnode(w1, w2)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["In the above, we can easily add in error mitigation using the ``@mitigate_with_zne`` decorator.

For example, the following three distinct\ncircuits are all folded with a scale factor of $s=1.1$:\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["for _ in range(3):\n    print(folding(circuit, scale_factor=1.1).draw())"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["To accommodate for this randomness, we can perform multiple repetitions of random folding for a\nfixed $s$ and average over the execution results to generate the value $f(s)$ used\nfor extrapolation.

For example, the\n`execute_with_zne <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#mitiq.zne.zne.execute_with_zne>`__\nfunction is one of the central components of ZNE support in Mitiq and is compatible with circuits\nconstructed using a PennyLane :class:`QuantumTape <pennylane.tape.QuantumTape>`. Working directly\nwith Mitiq can be preferable when more flexibility is required in specifying the error mitigation\nprotocol. For example, the code below shows how an adaptive approach can be used to determine a\nsequence of scale factors for extrapolation using Mitiq's\n`AdaExpFactory <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#mitiq.zne.inference.AdaExpFactory>`__.\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from mitiq.zne import execute_with_zne\nfrom mitiq.zne.inference import AdaExpFactory\n\nfactory = AdaExpFactory(steps=20)\n\nexecute_with_zne(circuit, executor, factory=factory, scale_noise=fold_global)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Recall that ``circuit`` is a PennyLane :class:`QuantumTape <pennylane.tape.QuantumTape>` and that\nit should not include measurements. We also use the ``executor`` function defined earlier that\nadds on the target measurement and executes on a noisy device.\n\nMitigating noisy circuits in quantum chemistry\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWe're now ready to apply our knowledge to a more practical problem in quantum chemistry:\ncalculating the potential energy surface of molecular hydrogen. This is achieved by finding the\nground state energy of $H_{2}$ as we increase the bond length between the hydrogen atoms. As\nshown in :doc:`this <tutorial_chemical_reactions>` tutorial, one approach to finding the ground\nstate energy is to calculate the corresponding qubit Hamiltonian and to fix an ansatz variational\nquantum circuit that returns its expectation value. We can then vary the parameters of the\ncircuit to minimize the energy.\n\nTo find the potential energy surface of $H_{2}$, we must choose a range of interatomic\ndistances and calculate the qubit Hamiltonian corresponding to each distance. We then optimize the\nvariational circuit with a new set of parameters for each Hamiltonian and plot the resulting\nenergies for each distance. In this demo, we compare the potential energy surface reconstructed\nwhen the optimized variational circuits are run on ideal, noisy, and noise-mitigated devices.\n\nInstead of modifying the :mod:`default.mixed <pennylane.devices.default_mixed>` device to add\nsimple noise as we do above, let's choose a noise model that is a little closer to physical\nhardware.

As well as understanding the basics of the ZNE method, we have also seen how mitigation\ncan be used to uplift the performance of noisy devices for practical tasks like quantum chemistry.\nOn the other hand, we've only just started to scratch the surface of what can be done with error\nmitigation. We can explore applying the ZNE method to other use cases, or even try out other\nmitigation methods like\n`probabilistic error cancellation <https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/pec-tutorial.html>`__.\nLet us know where your adventures take you, and the Mitiq and PennyLane teams will keep working to\nhelp make error mitigation as easy as possible!\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n..
