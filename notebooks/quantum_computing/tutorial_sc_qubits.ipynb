Last updated: 22 March 2022.*\n\n**Superconducting qubits** are among the most promising approaches to building quantum computers.\nIt is no surprise that this technology is being used by well-known tech companies in their quest\nto pioneer the quantum era. Google's Sycamore claimed quantum advantage back in 2019 [#Google2019]_ and, in 2021,\nIBM built its Eagle quantum computer with 127 qubits [#IBM2021]_! The central insight that allows for these\nquantum computers is that superconductivity is a quantum phenomenon, so we can use superconducting\ncircuits as quantum systems that we can control at will. We can actually bring the quantum world\nto a larger scale and manipulate it more freely!\n\nBy the end of this demo, you will learn how superconductors are used to create, prepare,\ncontrol, and measure the state of a qubit. Moreover, you will identify the strengths and\nweaknesses of this technology in terms of Di Vincenzo's criteria, as introduced in the\nbox below. You will be armed with the basic concepts to understand the main scientific\npapers on the topic and keep up-to-date with the newest developments.\n\n.. container:: alert alert-block alert-info\n\n    **Di Vincenzo's criteria**: In the year 2000, David DiVincenzo proposed a\n    wishlist for the experimental characteristics of a quantum computer [#DiVincenzo2000]_.\n    DiVincenzo's criteria have since become the main guideline for\n    physicists and engineers building quantum computers:\n\n    1. **Well-characterized and scalable qubits**. Many of the quantum systems that\n    we find in nature are not qubits, so we must find a way to make them behave as such.\n    Moreover, we need to put many of these systems together.\n\n    2. **Qubit initialization**. We must be able to prepare the same state repeatedly within\n    an acceptable margin of error.\n\n    3. **Long coherence times**. Qubits will lose their quantum properties after\n    interacting with their environment for a while. We would like them to last long\n    enough so that we can perform quantum operations.\n\n    4. **Universal set of gates**. We need to perform arbitrary operations on the\n    qubits. To do this, we require both single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates.\n\n    5. **Measurement of individual qubits**.

Let's begin by addressing a simpler question: why do conductors allow for the\neasy passage of electrons and insulating materials don't? Solid-state physics tells us that\nwhen an electric current travels through a material, the electrons therein come in two types.\n*Conduction electrons* flow freely through the material, while *valence electrons* are attached to\nthe atoms that form the material itself. A material is a good conductor of electricity\nif the valence electrons require no energy to be stripped from the atoms to become\nconduction electrons. Similarly, the material is a semi-conductor if the energy needed is small,\nand it's an insulator if the energy is large.\n\nBut, if conduction electrons can be obtained for free in conducting materials, then why don't all conductors\nhave infinite conductivity? Even the tiniest of stimuli should create a very large current!\nTo address this valid concern, let us recall the *exclusion principle* in atomic physics:\nthe atom's discrete energy levels have a population limit, so only a limited number of\nelectrons can have the same energy. However, the exclusion principle is not limited\nto electrons in atomic orbitals. In fact, it applies to all electrons that are\norganized in discrete energy levels. Since conduction electrons also occupy discrete\n*conduction energy levels*, they must also abide by this law! The conductivity is then limited because,\nwhen the lower conduction energy levels are occupied, the energy required to promote valence to\nconduction electrons is no longer zero. This energy will keep increasing as the population\nof conduction electrons grows.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/conduction_band.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Valence and conduction energy levels\n\nHowever, superconductors *do* have infinite conductivity. How is this even possible?\nIt's not a phenomenon that we see in our daily lives. For some materials,\nat extremely low temperatures, the conduction electrons attract the positive nuclei\nto form regions of high positive charge density, alternating with regions of\nlow charge density. This charge distribution oscillates in an organized manner,\ncreating waves in the material known as *phonons*. The conduction electrons are\npushed together by these phonons, forming *Cooper pairs*. Most importantly,\nthese coupled electrons need not obey the exclusion principle.\nWe no longer have an electron population limit in\nthe lower conduction energy levels, allowing for infinite conductivity!

The Qiskit, Amazon Braket, Cirq, and Rigetti PennyLane plugins\n   give you access to some of the most powerful superconducting quantum hardware.\n\n\n## Building an artificial atom\n\nWhen we code in PennyLane, we deal with the abstraction of a qubit. But how is a qubit\nactually implemented physically? Some of the most widely used real-life qubits are\nbuilt from individual atoms. But atoms are given to us by nature, and we cannot easily alter their properties.\nSo although they are reliable qubits, they are not very versatile. We may adapt our\ntechnology to the atoms, but they seldom adapt to our technology. Could there be a way to\nbuild a device with the same properties that make atoms suitable qubits?\nLet's see if we can build an artificial atom!\n\nOur first task is to isolate the features that an ideal qubit should have. First and foremost,\nwe must not forget that a qubit is a physical system with **two distinguishable configurations**\nthat correspond to the computational basis states. In the case of an atom, these are usually the\nground and excited states, $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle$, of a\nvalence electron. In atoms, we can distinguish these states reliably because the ground and excited\nstates have two distinct values of energy that can be resolved by our measuring devices. If we\nmeasure the energy of the valence electron that is in either  $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$\nor $\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle$, we will measure two \u2014 and only two \u2014 possible values\n$E_0$ and $E_1$, associated to $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$\nand $\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle$ respectively.\n\nMost importantly, the physical system under consideration must **exhibit quantum properties**.\nThe presence of **discrete energy levels** is indeed one such property, so if we do build a device that stores\nenergy in discrete values, we can suspect that it obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. Usually,\none thinks of a quantum system as being at least as small as a molecule, but building something\nso small is technologically impossible. It turns out that we don't need to go to such small\nscales. If we build a somewhat **small electric circuit using superconducting wires** and bring\nit to temperatures of about 10 mK, it becomes a quantum system with discrete energy levels.\n\nFinally, we must account for the fact that electrons in atoms have more states available than just\n$\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle$. In fact, the\nenergy levels in an atom are infinitely many. How do we guarantee that an electron does not\nescape to another state that is neither of our hand-picked states? The transition between the ground\nand the excited state only happens when the electron absorbs a photon (a particle of light) with energy\n$\\Delta E = E_1 - E_0$. To get to another state with energy $E_2$,\nthe electron would need to absorb a photon with energy $E_2 - E_1$ or $E_2-E_0$. In an atom,\nthese energy differences are always different: there is a **non-uniform spacing between the energy levels**.\nTherefore, if we limit ourselves to interacting with the atom using photons with energy $\\Delta E$,\nwe will not go beyond the states that define our qubit.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/photon_absorb.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Photons with a particular energy excite electrons\n\nLet's then build the simplest superconducting circuit. We do not want the circuit to warm up, or\nit will lose its quantum properties. Of all the elements that an ordinary circuit may have,\nonly two do not produce heat when they're superconducting: *capacitors* and *inductors*.\nCapacitors are two parallel metallic plates that store electric charge.\nThey are characterized by their *capacitance* $C$, which measures how much charge\nthey can store when connected to a given power source.  Inductors are wires shaped\nas a coil and store magnetic fields when a current passes through.\nThese magnetic fields, in turn, slow down changing currents that pass through the inductor.\nThey are described by an *inductance* $L$, which measures the strength of the magnetic field\nstored in the inductor at a fixed current. The simplest superconducting circuit is, therefore,\na capacitor connected to an inductor, also known as an LC circuit, as shown below:\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/LC_circuit.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Superconducting LC circuit\n\nSadly, this simple circuit has a problem: the spacing between energy levels is constant,\nwhich means identical photons will cause energy transitions between many neighbouring pairs of states.\nThis makes it impossible to isolate just two specific states for our qubit.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/anharmonic.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Non-uniform energy levels in an atom vs. uniform energy levels in a superconducting LC circuit\n\nBut there turns out to be a fix for the even spacing. Enter the *Josephson junction*. It consists of a very thin piece of an\ninsulating material placed between two superconducting metals. Why do we need this? If it's insulating,\nno current should go through it and our circuit should stop working! Here's where another\nfamous quantum effect comes into play: the *tunnel effect*. Due to the quantum-probabilistic\nbehaviour of their location, Cooper pairs can sometimes go through the Josephson junction, so\nthat the current is reduced but not completely stopped.\nIf we replace the inductor with one of these junctions, the energy levels of the superconducting\ncircuit become unevenly spaced, exactly as we wanted. We have built an artificial atom!\n\n## The transmon\n\nMission accomplished? Not yet. We want our qubit to be useful for building quantum computers.\nIn short, this means that we need to interact with the environment in a controlled way.\nA way to do this is to add a *gate capacitor* with capacitance $C_g$ to the artificial atom, so that it\ncan receive external signals (photons, in our case). The amount of charge $Q_g$ in this\ncapacitor can be chosen by the operator, and it determines how strongly the circuit\ninteracts with the environment.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/JC_circuit.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Circuit with a Josephson junction and a gate capacitor\n\nBut we run into a problem again. Adding a gate capacitor messes\nwith our uneven energy levels, which we worked so hard to obtain. The separation in energy\nlevels depends on $Q_g,$ as shown below [#Blais2021]_.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/energy_levels.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   First three energy levels (green, orange, purple) as a function of the charge in the gate capacitor.\n\nThe problem with this dependence is that a small change in the gate charge $Q_g$ can change the\ndifference in energy levels significantly. A solution to this issue is to work around the\nvalue $Q_g/2e = 1/2$, where the levels are not too sensitive to changes in the gate charge.\nBut there is a more straightforward solution: the difference in energy levels also depends\non the in-circuit capacitance $C$ and the physical characteristics of the junction. If we can make\nthe capacitance larger, the energy level differences become less sensitive to $Q_g$. So all we need\nto do is choose an appropriate capacitor.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/levels_capacitance.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 100%\n\n   ..\n\n   Energy levels vs gate capacitor charge for different values of in-circuit capacitance.\n\nBut there is a price to be paid: making the in-circuit capacitance $C$ larger does reduce the\nsensitivity to the gate charge, but it also makes the differences in energy levels more uniform.\nDoes that make the Josephson junction pointless? Thankfully, the latter effect turns out to be\nsmaller than the former, so we can adjust the capacitance value and preserve some non-uniformity.\nThe regime that has been proven ideal is known as the **transmon regime**, and artificial atoms\nin this regime are called **transmons**. They have proven to be highly effective as qubits,\nand they are used in many applications nowadays. We can thus work with the first two\nenergy levels of the transmon, which we will also denote $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$ and\n$\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle$, the ground and excited states respectively. The energy difference\nbetween these states is known as the *energy gap* $E_a$. We can stimulate transitions using\nphotons of frequency $\\omega_a$, where\n\n\\begin{align}E_a = \\hbar\\omega_a.\\end{align}\n\nWe have now partially satisfied Di Vincenzo's first criterion of a well-defined qubit,\nand we will discuss scalability later. A great feature of superconducting qubits is that\nthe second criterion is satisfied effortlessly. Since the excited states in an artificial\natom are short-lived and prefer to be on the ground state, all we have to do is wait for a\nshort period. If the circuit is well isolated, it is guaranteed that all the qubits will\nbe in the ground state with a high probability after this short interval.\n\n## Measuring the circuit's state\n\nNow that we have finally fabricated our qubit, we need to understand how to manipulate it.\nThe way to do this is to put the qubit inside an *optical cavity*, a metal box where we can\ncontain electromagnetic waves. Our focus will be on the so-called *Fabry-Perot* cavities.\nThey consist of two mirrors facing each other and whose rears are coated with an anti-reflecting\nmaterial. Something surprising happens when we shine a beam of light on a  Fabry-Perot cavity of\nlength $L$: electromagnetic waves will only be transmitted when they have a wavelength $\\lambda$\nsuch that\n\n\\begin{align}L = n\\lambda/2,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $n$ is an arbitrary positive integer. If this condition is not met, most of the photons in the wave will be reflected away.\nTherefore, we will have an electromagnetic field inside if we carefully tune our light source to one of these\nwavelengths. For superconducting qubits, it is most\ncommon to use wavelengths in the microwave range.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/fabry_perot.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   The Fabry-Perot Cavity rejects most of the red wave but allows all of the blue wave, since\n   an integer number of blue wavelengths fit exactly in the cavity.\n\nFollowing Di Vincenzo's fifth criterion, let's see how we can measure the state of the qubit placed inside the cavity.\nTo obtain information, we need to shine light at a frequency $\\omega_r$ that the cavity lets through\n(recall that the frequency and the wavelength are related via $\\omega = 2\\pi c/\\lambda$, where $c$ is the speed of light).\nWe may also choose the frequency value $\\omega_r$ to be far from the transmon's frequency gap $\\omega_a$, so the qubit\ndoes not absorb the photons. Namely, the *detuning* $\\Delta$ needs to be large:\n\n\\begin{align}\\Delta \\equiv \\left\\lvert \\omega_r - \\omega_a \\right\\rvert \\gg 1.\\end{align}\n\nWhat happens to the photons of this frequency that meet paths with the qubit? They are scattered by the circuit,\nas opposed to photons of frequency $\\omega_a$, which get absorbed. Scattering counts as an interaction,\nalbeit a weak one, so the scattered photons contain some information about the qubit's state.\nIndeed, the collision causes an exchange in momentum and energy. For the photon, this means that its\nfrequency will change slightly. If we carefully measure the frequency of the scattered photons,\nwe can distill the information about the state of the qubit and measure its state.\n\nTo understand how this works in more detail, we need to do some hands-on calculations. We will rely on the concept\nof a Hamiltonian; do read the blue box below if you need a refresher on the topic!\n\n.. container:: alert alert-block alert-info\n\n   **Primer on Hamiltonians:** When a physical system is exposed to outside influences, it will change configurations.\n   One way to describe these external interactions is through a mathematical object called a **Hamiltonian**, which\n   represents the total energy on the system. In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is a Hermitian matrix whose eigenvalues\n   represent the possible energies the system may have. The Hamiltonian also tells us how an initial state changes\n   in time. In quantum mechanics, this change is described by a differential equation known as Schrodinger's equation:\n\n   .. math:: i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left\\lvert \\psi(t)\\right\\rangle = \\hat{H}\\left\\lvert \\psi(t)\\right\\rangle.\n\n   When the Hamiltonian does not depend on time, this equation can be solved exactly:\n\n   .. math:: \\left\\lvert \\psi(t)\\right\\rangle= \\exp(-i\\hat{H}t/\\hbar)\\left\\lvert \\psi(0)\\right\\rangle\n\n   where $\\exp$ represents the matrix exponential. Don't worry, there's no need to know how to solve this equation\n   or calculate matrix exponentials. Pennylane can do this for us using ``ApproxTimeEvolution``.\n\n\nWe are given a Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ that describes the transmon and the photons inside the cavity.\nThe transmon is initially in its ground state $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle,$ and the cavity starts\nwithout any photons in it, i.e., in the *vacuum state* denoted by $\\left\\lvert 0 \\right\\rangle$.\nAccording to Schrodinger's equation,  the state of the cavity (transmon and photons system) evolves\ninto $\\left\\lvert \\psi(t)\\right\\rangle= \\exp(-i\\hat{H}t/\\hbar)\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle\\left\\lvert 0 \\right\\rangle$\nafter a time $t$. What is the Hamiltonian that describes light of amplitude $\\epsilon$\nand frequency $\\omega_r$ incident on the cavity, when the detuning $\\Delta$ is large?\nDeriving the Hamiltonian is not an easy job, so we should trust physicists on this one!  The Hamiltonian turns out\nto be\n\n\\begin{align}\\hat{H}=\\hbar(\\omega_r I+\\chi\\hat{\\sigma}_z)\\otimes\\hat{N} + \\hbar\\epsilon I\\otimes \\hat{P},\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\hat{N}$ counts the number of photons in the cavity, $\\hat{P}$ is the photon momentum operator, and\n$\\epsilon$ is the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave incident on the cavity. The shift $\\chi$ is\na quantity that depends on the circuit and gate capacitances and the detuning $\\Delta$.\n\nThe effect of this evolution can be calculated explicitly. Shining microwaves on the cavity gives\nus a *coherent state* of light contained in it, which is the state of light that lasers give out.\nCoherent states are completely determined by two quantities called $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{p}$\n(these quantities are mathematically similar to the notions of average position and average momentum,\nbut are in fact physically connected to the phase of the light),\nso we will denote them via $\\left\\lvert \\bar{x}, \\bar{p}\\right\\rangle$. For the state of the qubit and cavity\nsystem, we write the ket in the form $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert \\bar{x}, \\bar{p}\\right\\rangle$.\nThe Hamiltonian above has (approximately) the following effect:\n\n\\begin{align}\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert 0 \\right\\rangle \\rightarrow \\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert \\epsilon t, (\\omega_r+\\chi)t \\right\\rangle,\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{align}\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert 0 \\right\\rangle \\rightarrow \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert \\epsilon t, (\\omega_r-\\chi)t \\right\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nConsequently, if the state of the qubit was initially the superposition\n$\\alpha \\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle +\\beta \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle$, then the qubit-cavity system would evolve to the state\n\n\\begin{align}\\left\\lvert\\psi(t)\\right\\rangle=\\alpha \\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert \\epsilon t, (\\omega_r+\\chi)t \\right\\rangle +\\beta \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert \\epsilon t, (\\omega_r-\\chi)t \\right\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nIn general, this state represents an entangled state between the qubit and the cavity. So if we measure the state of the light\ntrapped by the cavity, we can determine the qubit's state as well.\n\nLet us see how this works in practice using PennyLane. The ``default.gaussian`` device allows us to simulate\ncoherent states of light. These states start implicitly in the vacuum (no photons) state.\nThe PennyLane function ``qml.Displacement(x,0)`` applies a *displacement operator*, which creates\na coherent state $\\left\\lvert \\bar{x}, 0\\right\\rangle$. The rotation operator ``qml.Rotation(phi)`` rotates the state\n$\\left\\lvert \\bar{x}, 0\\right\\rangle$ in $(x, p)$ space. When applied after a large displacement,\nit changes the value of $\\bar{x}$ only slightly, but noticeably changes the value of $\\bar{p}$ by shifting it\noff from zero, as shown in the figure [#Blais2021]_:\n\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/phase_space.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Translation and rotation in the position-momentum picture\n\nIt turns out that this sequence of operations implements the evolution of the cavity state exactly. Note that here we are\ntaking $\\omega_r=0$, which simply corresponds to taking $\\omega_r$ as a reference frequency, so a rotation by\nangle $\\phi$ actually means a rotation by $\\omega_r+\\phi$.

However, this poses a problem: being a relatively large object, the state of the\nqubit is rather short-lived due to decoherence. Therefore, taking a long time to make\nthe measurement introduces additional inaccuracies: the qubits may lose quantum\nproperties due to decoherence before we even finish measuring! An outstanding\nchallenge for superconducting qubit technologies is to perform measurements as fast\nas possible, in times well below the decoherence time.\n\n## Superconducting single-qubit gates\n\nWe have seen that shining light with  detuning $\\Delta \\gg 1$ is used to perform indirect measurements.\nA rather different choice, $\\omega_r =\\omega_a$ ($\\Delta=0$), allows us to manipulate the state\nof the qubit. But does the Fabry-Perot cavity transmit these photons if their wavelength does not\nallow it? We must emphasize that the cavity reflects only the vast majority of photons,\nbut not all of them.

Why do they have this intrinsic advantage? The reason is that the\nRabi frequency $\\Omega_R$, which grows with the size of the qubit and the magnitude of the electric field,\nis extremely high.  We have the technology to make very small cavities, which means we can pack strong\nelectric fields in a small region. Moreover, superconducting qubits are billions of times larger than\nother qubits, such as atoms. The drawback is that superconducting qubit technology would be\nimpossible without these extremely high speeds: large qubits are extremely short-lived, so we are\nconstrained to find the quickest ways to perform all quantum operations.\n\n## Two-qubit gates\n\nOne of the main challenges in all realizations of quantum computers is building two-qubit gates,\nneeded to satisfy Di Vincenzo's fourth criterion in full. An advantage of superconducting technology\nis the variety of options to connect qubits with each other. There are many options for this connection:\ndo we just connect the two qubits with a superconducting wire, do we just put them in the same cavity?\nOne of the best ways is via *capacitative coupling*, where we connect two transmons through\na wire and *coupling capacitor*.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/capacitative.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Two transmons connected through a coupling capacitor\n\nAs we will see, this capacitor helps us have\na controlled interaction between qubits. When two **identical** transmons are connected through a coupling\ncapacitor, the Hamiltonian for the system of two qubits reads [#Schuch2003]_\n\n\\begin{align}\\hat{H}=\\frac{\\hbar J}{2} (\\sigma^{x}_1\\sigma^{x}_2+\\sigma^{y}_1\\sigma^{y}_2),\\end{align}\n\nwhere $J$ depends on the coupling capacitance and the characteristics of both circuits. Note that since the transmons are\nidentical, they have the same energy gap.\nThe Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ allows us to implement the two-qubit $iSWAP$ gate\n\n\\begin{align}iSWAP = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & i & 0 \\\\ 0 & i & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array} \\right)\\end{align}\n\nwhen applied for a time $t=3\\pi/2J$, as shown with the following PennyLane code:\n\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["dev3 = qml.device(\"default.qubit\", wires=2)\n\n# Define Hamiltonian\ncoeffs = [0.5, 0.5]\nops = [qml.PauliX(0) @ qml.PauliX(1), qml.PauliY(0) @ qml.PauliY(1)]\n\nTwo_qubit_H = qml.Hamiltonian(coeffs, ops)\n\n# Implement Hamiltonian evolution for time t and some initial computational basis state\n@qml.qnode(dev3)\ndef Sc_ISWAP(basis_state, time):\n    qml.templates.BasisStatePreparation(basis_state, wires=range(2))\n    ApproxTimeEvolution(Two_qubit_H, time, 1)\n    return qml.state()\n\n\n# Implement ISWAP exactly\n@qml.qnode(dev3)\ndef iswap(basis_state):\n    qml.templates.BasisStatePreparation(basis_state, wires=range(2))\n    qml.ISWAP(wires=[0, 1])\n    return qml.state()\n\n\n# Print to compare results\n\nprint(\"State |0>|0>:\")\nprint(\n    \"Evolved for t=3*pi/2: {}; Output of ISWAP gate: {}\\n \".format(\n        Sc_ISWAP([0, 0], 3 * np.pi / 2).round(2), iswap([0, 0]).round(2)\n    )\n)\n\nprint(\"State |0>|1>:\")\nprint(\n    \"Evolved for t=3*pi/2: {}; Output of ISWAP gate: {}\\n \".format(\n        Sc_ISWAP([0, 1], 3 * np.pi / 2).round(2), iswap([0, 1]).round(2)\n    )\n)\n\nprint(\"State |1>|0>:\")\nprint(\n    \"Evolved for t=3*pi/2: {}; Output of ISWAP gate: {}\\n \".format(\n        Sc_ISWAP([1, 0], 3 * np.pi / 2).round(2), iswap([1, 0]).round(2)\n    )\n)\n\nprint(\"State |1>|1>:\")\nprint(\n    \"Evolved for t=3*pi/2: {}; Output of ISWAP gate: {}\\n \".format(\n        Sc_ISWAP([1, 1], 3 * np.pi / 2).round(2), iswap([1, 1]).round(2)\n    )\n)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["To allow for universal computation, we must be able to build the ``CNOT`` gate by using only the ``ISWAP``\ngate and any number of single-qubit gates.

For example, if we change the inductance\nin one of the circuits to be much different from the other, the interaction strength $J$ in\nthe Hamiltonian will be almost zero.\n\nThis strategy, however, begs another question: how can we change the characteristics of the circuit elements on-demand? One possibility is to use\n**flux-tunable qubits**, also known as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs).\nThey use two parallel Josephson junctions placed around each circuit, a setup that allows us to change the\ninductance of one qubit using an external magnetic field. This architecture,\nalthough fast, requires further interaction with the qubit, so there's some probability of unintentionally\nchanging its state.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/sc_qubits/squid.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   SQUID architecture surrounding a transmon\n\nAnother option is to use **all-microwave gates**.

One of the most common is the **xmon**, which are transmons coupled\n   with a \"+\" shaped capacitor. A further improvement over the xmon is the **gmon**, which adds an additional\n   inductor to the coupling to better switch interactions on and off. Many more architectures have been\n   proposed since the introduction of the xmon and the gmon, so we have reached a point where it is\n   better to avoid getting lost in names. Understanding the basic principles introduced\n   above will make us go a long way!\n\n## The state of the art\n\nSuperconducting qubits are a force to be reckoned with as practical implementations of quantum computers.\nNonetheless, there are still some technological challenges preventing them from scaling further.\nA glaring issue is that we need to keep the transmons at very low temperatures, which requires the use of\nlarge cryogenic devices known as *dilution refrigerators*. However, many quantum computing\ntechnologies need to use cryogenic devices for different reasons. In the future, other quantum\ntechnologies may bypass the use of low temperatures, but superconducting qubits may not be so lucky, since\nthey are constrained by the laws of physics that allow for superconductivity.\n\nIn terms of Di Vincenzo's criteria, the long coherence times required by the\nthird criterion have been rather hard to achieve. Superconducting circuits are\nlarge compared to other quantum systems, so their interaction with the environment is difficult to control.\nAs a consequence, the excited state lasts for about 1 micro-second before decaying back to the ground state.\nCurrent single-qubit gates are acceptable since they can be applied in a matter of nanoseconds,\nthanks to our ability to manufacture very small cavities. Problems arise, however, when we\nwant to perform precise measurements of the qubit. We've already seen that taking a longer\ntime to perform a measurement gives us better precision. But there is an additional issue:\nthe Hamiltonian we wrote in the measurement section is only\nvalid when the number of photons in the cavity does not exceed some critical number.\nThis upper bound on the photons sets additional constraints:\nwe will need longer times to resolve the state, since we have few photons available to us.\n\nSpeeding up measurements without losing precision is a hot research topic in superconductor\nquantum computing. The primary approach has been to make the most out of the limited number of\nphotons we have by reducing all possible environmental noise. Currently, we can perform\nmeasurements in about 50 nanoseconds with 1% error. However, since frequent measurements\nare needed for error correction, better precision and shorter times are required\nto scale our architectures further.\n\nAn additional challenge is the execution of the multi-qubit gates, which are currently ten times\nslower than single-qubit gates. One contender to the fastest two-qubit gate is used by Google,\nwhere the qubits are coupled with a capacitor and a SQUID. The net effect is a quick flux-tunable\nqubit, where the coupling $J$ is changed by using a magnetic flux that goes through the coupling SQUID.\nWhile slower, IBM prefers to use all-microwave gates to increase coherence times. Both approaches have\nthe problem of *frequency crowding*: if we interconnect too many qubits together inside a cavity, they\nmay start to have similar energy gaps. In that case, we may manipulate qubits that we did\nnot intend to. The problem can be somewhat addressed by changing the geometry in which the qubits\nare connected [#IBMHex2021]_. However, much more work needs to be done to address this scalability issue.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nSuperconducting quantum computing has gained momentum in the last decade as a leading competitor\nin the race for building a functional quantum computer. It is based on artificial versions of atomic systems\ndone using superconducting circuits, which allows for versatility and control.\nThey have been easy to scale so far, but increasing the qubit coherence time and the speed of quantum\noperations and measurements is essential to scaling this technology further. This has motivated so\nmany approaches for gates and measurement that we could not possibly cover them\nall in one demo.
