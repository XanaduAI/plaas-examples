Posted: 13 Oct 2020. Last updated: 21 Jan 2021.*\n\nQuantum computing architectures come in many flavours: superconducting qubits, ion traps,\nphotonics, silicon, and more. One very interesting physical substrate is *neutral atoms*. These\nquantum devices have some basic similarities to ion traps. Ion-trap devices make use of atoms\nthat have an imbalance between protons (positively charged) and electrons (negatively charged).\nNeutral atoms, on the other hand, have an equal number of protons and electrons.\n\nIn neutral-atom systems, the individual atoms can be easily programmed into various two- or\nthree-dimensional configurations. Like ion-trap systems, individual qubits can be encoded into\nthe energy levels of the atoms. The qubits thus retain the three-dimensional geometry of their\nhost atoms. Qubits that are nearby in space can be programmed to interact with one another\nvia two-qubit gates. This opens up some tantalizing possibilities for exotic quantum-computing\ncircuit topologies.\n\n.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhenriet/cirq-pasqal/fc4f9c7792a8737fde76d4c05828aa538be8452e/pasqal-tutorials/files/eiffel_tower.png\n    :align: center\n    :width: 50%\n\n    ..\n\n    Neutral atoms (green dots) arranged in various configurations. These atoms can be\n    used to encode qubits and carry out quantum computations. Image originally from [#barredo2017]_.\n\nThe startup `Pasqal <https://pasqal.io/>`_ is one of the companies working to bring\nneutral-atom quantum computing devices to the world. To support this new class of devices,\nPasqal has contributed some new features to the quantum software library `Cirq <https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.\n\nIn this demo, we will use PennyLane, Cirq, and TensorFlow to show off the unique abilities of\nneutral atom devices, leveraging them to make a variational quantum circuit which has a\nvery unique topology: *the Eiffel tower*. Specifically, we will build a simple toy\ncircuit whose qubits are arranged like the Eiffel tower.
