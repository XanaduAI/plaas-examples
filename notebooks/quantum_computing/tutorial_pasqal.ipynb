Posted: 13 Oct 2020. Last updated: 21 Jan\n2021.*\n\nQuantum computing architectures come in many flavours: superconducting\nqubits, ion traps, photonics, silicon, and more. One very interesting\nphysical substrate is *neutral atoms*. These quantum devices have some\nbasic similarities to ion traps. Ion-trap devices make use of atoms that\nhave an imbalance between protons (positively charged) and electrons\n(negatively charged). Neutral atoms, on the other hand, have an equal\nnumber of protons and electrons.\n\nIn neutral-atom systems, the individual atoms can be easily programmed\ninto various two- or three-dimensional configurations. Like ion-trap\nsystems, individual qubits can be encoded into the energy levels of the\natoms. The qubits thus retain the three-dimensional geometry of their\nhost atoms. Qubits that are nearby in space can be programmed to\ninteract with one another via two-qubit gates. This opens up some\ntantalizing possibilities for exotic quantum-computing circuit\ntopologies.\n\n![..](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhenriet/cirq-pasqal/fc4f9c7792a8737fde76d4c05828aa538be8452e/pasqal-tutorials/files/eiffel_tower.png)\n\nNeutral atoms (green dots) arranged in various configurations.

To support\nthis new class of devices, Pasqal has contributed some new features to\nthe quantum software library\n[Cirq](https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\nIn this demo, we will use PennyLane, Cirq, and TensorFlow to show off\nthe unique abilities of neutral atom devices, leveraging them to make a\nvariational quantum circuit which has a very unique topology: *the\nEiffel tower*. Specifically, we will build a simple toy circuit whose\nqubits are arranged like the Eiffel tower. The girders between the\npoints on the tower will represent two-qubit gates, with the final\noutput of our variational circuit coming at the very peak of the tower.\n\nLet\\'s get to it!\n\n> **Note**\n> \n> To run this demo locally, you will need to install\n> [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq), (version \\>= 0.9.1), and the\n> [PennyLane-cirq\n> plugin](https://pennylane-cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (version \\>=\n> 0.13).
