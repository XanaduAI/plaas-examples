Posted: 4 Dec 2020. Last updated: 4 Dec 2020.*\n\nOn the journey to large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers, one of the first major\nmilestones is to demonstrate a quantum device carrying out tasks that are beyond the reach of\nany classical algorithm. The Google Quantum team was the first to claim this achievement,\nannounced in their paper `Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting\nprocessor <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5>`__ [#Arute2019]_. Now a team led\nby Chao-Yang Lu and Jian-Wei Pan has performed a similar feat using quantum photonics. While\nGoogle's experiment performed the task of :doc:`random circuit sampling </demos/qsim_beyond_classical>`\nusing a superconducting processor, the new experiment, published in the paper\n`Quantum computational advantage using photons\n<https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/12/02/science.abe8770?rss=1>`__\n[#Zhong2020]_ leverages the quantum properties of light to tackle a task called\n`Gaussian Boson Sampling <https://strawberryfields.ai/photonics/concepts/gbs.html>`__ (GBS).\n\nThis tutorial will walk you through the basic elements of GBS, motivate why it is\nclassically challenging, and show you how to explore GBS using PennyLane and the photonic\nquantum devices accessible via the\n`PennyLane-Strawberry Fields plugin <https://pennylane-sf.readthedocs.io>`__. If you are\ninterested in possible applications of GBS, or want to access programmable GBS hardware\nvia the cloud, check out the\n`Strawberry Fields website <https://strawberryfields.ai/>`__ for more details.\n\n|\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/tutorial_gbs_expt2.png)\n\n    :align: center\n    :width: 80%\n    :target: javascript:void(0);\n\n.. figure:: /demonstrations/tutorial_gbs_expt1.png\n    :align: center\n    :width: 80%\n    :target: javascript:void(0);\n\n    *Illustration of the experimental setup used by Zhong et al. in Quantum computational advantage\n    using photons* [#Zhong2020]_.\n\nThe origins of GBS\n------------------\n\nLet's first explain the name. `Boson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson>`__ refers to bosonic\nmatter, which, along with fermions, makes up one of the two elementary classes of particles.\nThe most prevalent bosonic system in our everyday lives is light, which is made of particles\ncalled photons. Another famous example, though much harder to find, is the Higgs boson.\nThe distinguishing characteristic of bosons is that they follow \"Bose-Einstein statistics\",\nwhich very loosely means that the particles like to bunch together (contrast this to fermionic\nmatter like electrons, which must follow the Pauli Exclusion Principle and keep apart).\n\nThis property can be observed in simple interference experiments such as the\n`Hong-Ou Mandel setup <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong%E2%80%93Ou%E2%80%93Mandel_effect>`__.\nIf two single photons are interfered on a balanced beamsplitter, they will both emerge at\nthe same output port---there is zero probability that they will emerge at separate outputs.\nThis is a simple but notable quantum property of light; if electrons were brought\ntogether in a similar experiement, they would always appear at separate output ports.\n\nGaussian Boson Sampling [#hamilton2017]_ is, in fact, a member of a larger family of\n\"Boson Sampling\" algorithms,\nstemming back to the initial proposal of Aaronson and Arkhipov [#aaronson2013]_ in 2013.\nBoson Sampling is quantum interferometry writ large. Aaronson and Arkhipov's original proposal\nwas to inject many single photons into distinct input ports of a large interferometer, then\nmeasure which output ports they appear at. The natural interference properties of bosons\nmeans that photons will appear at the output ports in very unique and specific ways. Boson\nSampling was not proposed with any kind of practical real-world use-case in mind. Like\nthe random circuit sampling, it's just a quantum system being its best self. With sufficient\nsize and quality, it is strongly believed to be hard for a classical computer to simulate this efficiently.\n\nFinally, the \"Gaussian\" in GBS refers to the fact that we modify the original Boson Sampling\nproposal slightly: instead of injecting single photons---which are hard to jointly create in the\nsize and quality needed to demonstrate Boson Sampling conclusively---we instead use states of\nlight that are experimentally less demanding (though still challenging!).\nThese states of light are called Gaussian states,\nbecause they bear strong connections to the\n`Gaussian (or Normal) distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution>`__\nfrom statistics. In practice, we use a particular Gaussian state called a\n`squeezed state <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezed_states_of_light>`__ for the inputs,\nsince these are arguably the most non-classical of Gaussian states.\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>While computationally hard to simulate, Boson Sampling devices, on their own,\n          are not capable of universal quantum computing. However, in combination with other\n          components, GBS is a key building block for a\n          universal device [#Bourassa2020]_.</p></div>\n\n\nCoding a GBS algorithm\n----------------------\n\nThe researchers in [#Zhong2020]_ experimentally demonstrate a GBS device by preparing 50\nsqueezed states and injecting them into a 100-mode interferometer. In this demo,\nin order to keep things classically simulable, we will stick to a much simpler setting\nconsisting of 4 squeezed states injected into a 4-mode interferometer. At a high level,\nan interferometer on $N$ modes can be represented using an $N\\times N$ unitary\nmatrix $U$. When decomposed into a quantum optical circuit, the interferometer will\nbe made up of beamsplitters and phase shifters.\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/tutorial_gbs_circuit2.png)\n\n    :align: center\n    :width: 90%\n    :target: javascript:void(0);\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n    <br>\n\nSimulating this circuit using PennyLane is easy; we can simply read off the gates from left\nto right, and convert it into a QNode.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import numpy as np\n\n# set the random seed\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# import PennyLane\nimport pennylane as qml"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["We must define the unitary matrix we would like to embed in the circuit.\nWe will use SciPy to generate a Haar-random unitary:\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from scipy.stats import unitary_group\n\n# define the linear interferometer\nU = unitary_group.rvs(4)\nprint(U)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["We can now use this to construct the circuit, choosing a compatible\ndevice.

Notably, the permanent appears in vanilla Boson Sampling in a similar way\n    that the hafnian appears in GBS.\n    The hafnian turns out to be a generalization of the permanent, with the relationship\n\n    .. math::\n\n        \\text{Per(A)} = \\text{Haf}\\left(\\left[\\begin{matrix}\n            0&A\\\\ A^T&0\n        \\end{matrix}\\right]\\right).</p></div>\n\nAs any algorithm that could calculate (or even approximate) the hafnian could also calculate the\npermanent---a `#P-hard problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%99%AFP>`__---it follows that\ncalculating or approximating the hafnian must also be a classically hard problem. This lies behind\nthe classical hardness of GBS.\n\nIn this demo, we will use the same squeezing parameter, $z=r$, for\nall input states; this allows us to simplify this equation. To start with, the hafnian expression\nsimply becomes $\\text{Haf}[(UU^T\\tanh(r))]_{st}$, removing the need for the direct sum.\n\nThus, we have\n\n\\begin{align}\\left|\\left\\langle{n_1,n_2,\\dots,n_N}\\middle|{\\psi'}\\right\\rangle\\right|^2 =\n    \\frac{\\left|\\text{Haf}[(UU^T\\tanh(r))]_{st}\\right|^2}{n_1!n_2!\\cdots n_N!\\cosh^N(r)}.\\end{align}\n\nNow that we have the theoretical formulas, as well as the probabilities from our simulated GBS\nQNode, we can compare the two and see whether they agree.\n\nIn order to calculate the probability of different GBS events classically, we need a\nmethod for calculating the hafnian.\nFor this, we will use `The Walrus\n<https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io>`_ library (which is installed as a dependency of the\nPennyLane-SF plugin):\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from thewalrus import hafnian as haf"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Now, for the right-hand side numerator, we first calculate the submatrix\n$A = [(UU^T\\tanh(r))]_{st}$:\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["A = (np.dot(U, U.T) * np.tanh(1))"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["In GBS, we determine the submatrix by taking the\nrows and columns corresponding to the measured Fock state.
