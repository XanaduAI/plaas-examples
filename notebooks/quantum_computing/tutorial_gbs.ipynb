Posted: 4 Dec 2020. Last updated: 4 Dec\n2020.*\n\nOn the journey to large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers, one of\nthe first major milestones is to demonstrate a quantum device carrying\nout tasks that are beyond the reach of any classical algorithm. The\nGoogle Quantum team was the first to claim this achievement, announced\nin their paper [Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting\nprocessor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5). Now a\nteam led by Chao-Yang Lu and Jian-Wei Pan has performed a similar feat\nusing quantum photonics. While Google\\'s experiment performed the task\nof\n[random circuit sampling](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/qsim_beyond_classical.html) using a superconducting processor, the new experiment,\npublished in the paper [Quantum computational advantage using\nphotons](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/12/02/science.abe8770?rss=1)\nleverages the quantum properties of light to tackle a task called\n[Gaussian Boson\nSampling](https://strawberryfields.ai/photonics/concepts/gbs.html)\n(GBS).\n\nThis tutorial will walk you through the basic elements of GBS, motivate\nwhy it is classically challenging, and show you how to explore GBS using\nPennyLane and the photonic quantum devices accessible via the\n[PennyLane-Strawberry Fields\nplugin](https://pennylane-sf.readthedocs.io). If you are interested in\npossible applications of GBS, or want to access programmable GBS\nhardware via the cloud, check out the [Strawberry Fields\nwebsite](https://strawberryfields.ai/) for more details.\n\n| \n\n[![image](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/tutorial_gbs_expt2.png)](javascript:void(0);)\n\n![*Illustration of the experimental setup used by Zhong et al. in\nQuantum computational advantage using\nphotons*.](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/tutorial_gbs_expt1.png)\n\nThe origins of GBS\n------------------\n\nLet\\'s first explain the name.\n[Boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson) refers to bosonic matter,\nwhich, along with fermions, makes up one of the two elementary classes\nof particles. The most prevalent bosonic system in our everyday lives is\nlight, which is made of particles called photons. Another famous\nexample, though much harder to find, is the Higgs boson. The\ndistinguishing characteristic of bosons is that they follow\n\\\"Bose-Einstein statistics\\\", which very loosely means that the\nparticles like to bunch together (contrast this to fermionic matter like\nelectrons, which must follow the Pauli Exclusion Principle and keep\napart).\n\nThis property can be observed in simple interference experiments such as\nthe [Hong-Ou Mandel\nsetup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong%E2%80%93Ou%E2%80%93Mandel_effect).\nIf two single photons are interfered on a balanced beamsplitter, they\nwill both emerge at the same output port\\-\\--there is zero probability\nthat they will emerge at separate outputs. This is a simple but notable\nquantum property of light; if electrons were brought together in a\nsimilar experiement, they would always appear at separate output ports.\n\nGaussian Boson Sampling is, in fact, a member of a larger family of\n\\\"Boson Sampling\\\" algorithms, stemming back to the initial proposal of\nAaronson and Arkhipov in 2013. Boson Sampling is quantum interferometry\nwrit large. Aaronson and Arkhipov\\'s original proposal was to inject\nmany single photons into distinct input ports of a large interferometer,\nthen measure which output ports they appear at. The natural interference\nproperties of bosons means that photons will appear at the output ports\nin very unique and specific ways. Boson Sampling was not proposed with\nany kind of practical real-world use-case in mind. Like the random\ncircuit sampling, it\\'s just a quantum system being its best self. With\nsufficient size and quality, it is strongly believed to be hard for a\nclassical computer to simulate this efficiently.\n\nFinally, the \\\"Gaussian\\\" in GBS refers to the fact that we modify the\noriginal Boson Sampling proposal slightly: instead of injecting single\nphotons\\-\\--which are hard to jointly create in the size and quality\nneeded to demonstrate Boson Sampling conclusively\\-\\--we instead use\nstates of light that are experimentally less demanding (though still\nchallenging!). These states of light are called Gaussian states, because\nthey bear strong connections to the [Gaussian (or Normal)\ndistribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) from\nstatistics. In practice, we use a particular Gaussian state called a\n[squeezed state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezed_states_of_light)\nfor the inputs, since these are arguably the most non-classical of\nGaussian states.\n\n> **Note**\n> \n> While computationally hard to simulate, Boson Sampling devices, on their\n> own, are not capable of universal quantum computing. However, in\n> combination with other components, GBS is a key building block for a\n> universal device.\n\n\n\nCoding a GBS algorithm\n----------------------\n\nThe researchers in experimentally demonstrate a GBS device by preparing\n50 squeezed states and injecting them into a 100-mode interferometer. In\nthis demo, in order to keep things classically simulable, we will stick\nto a much simpler setting consisting of 4 squeezed states injected into\na 4-mode interferometer. At a high level, an interferometer on $N$ modes\ncan be represented using an $N\\times N$ unitary matrix $U$. When\ndecomposed into a quantum optical circuit, the interferometer will be\nmade up of beamsplitters and phase shifters.\n\n[![image](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/tutorial_gbs_circuit2.png)](javascript:void(0);)\n\nSimulating this circuit using PennyLane is easy; we can simply read off\nthe gates from left to right, and convert it into a QNode.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import numpy as np\n\n# set the random seed\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# import PennyLane\nimport pennylane as qml"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["We must define the unitary matrix we would like to embed in the circuit.\nWe will use SciPy to generate a Haar-random unitary:\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["from scipy.stats import unitary_group\n\n# define the linear interferometer\nU = unitary_group.rvs(4)\nprint(U)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["We can now use this to construct the circuit, choosing a compatible\ndevice.

This lies behind the classical hardness of GBS.\n\nIn this demo, we will use the same squeezing parameter, $z=r$, for all\ninput states; this allows us to simplify this equation.
