They faced their quantum chip off against JEWEL---one of the\nworld's most powerful supercomputers---using a classical statevector simulator called\n`qsim <https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim>`__. The main idea behind this\nshowdown was to prove that a quantum device could solve a specific task\nthat no classical method could do in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nFor the face-off, a pseudo-random quantum circuit was constructed by alternating\nsingle-qubit and two-qubit gates in a specific, semi-random pattern. This\nprocedure gives a random unitary transformation which is\ncompatible with the Sycamore hardware. The circuit output is\nmeasured many times, producing a set of sampled bitstrings.\nThe more qubits there are, and the deeper the circuit is, the more difficult\nit becomes to simulate and sample this\nbitstring distribution classically. By comparing run-times for the\nclassical simulations and the Sycamore chip\non smaller circuits, and then extrapolating classical run-times for larger\ncircuits, the team concluded that simulating larger circuits on Sycamore\nwas intractable classically---i.e., the Sycamore chips had demonstrated\nwhat is called \"quantum supremacy\".\n\nIn this demonstration, we will walk you through how their random quantum\ncircuits were constructed, how the performance was measured via\ncross-entropy benchmarks, and provide reusable examples of their classical\nsimulations.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>We will be using PennyLane along with the aformentioned\n    ``qsim`` simulator running via our `PennyLane-Cirq plugin\n    <https://pennylane-cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
