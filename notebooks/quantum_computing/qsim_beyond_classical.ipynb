Posted: 30 Nov 2020.*\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/qc.png)\n\nIn the paper [Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting\nprocessor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5), the\nGoogle AI Quantum team and collaborators showed that the Sycamore\nquantum processor could complete a task that would take a classical\ncomputer potentially thousands of years. They faced their quantum chip\noff against JEWEL\\-\\--one of the world\\'s most powerful\nsupercomputers\\-\\--using a classical statevector simulator called\n[qsim](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim). The main idea behind this\nshowdown was to prove that a quantum device could solve a specific task\nthat no classical method could do in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nFor the face-off, a pseudo-random quantum circuit was constructed by\nalternating single-qubit and two-qubit gates in a specific, semi-random\npattern. This procedure gives a random unitary transformation which is\ncompatible with the Sycamore hardware. The circuit output is measured\nmany times, producing a set of sampled bitstrings. The more qubits there\nare, and the deeper the circuit is, the more difficult it becomes to\nsimulate and sample this bitstring distribution classically. By\ncomparing run-times for the classical simulations and the Sycamore chip\non smaller circuits, and then extrapolating classical run-times for\nlarger circuits, the team concluded that simulating larger circuits on\nSycamore was intractable classically\\-\\--i.e., the Sycamore chips had\ndemonstrated what is called \\\"quantum supremacy\\\".\n\nIn this demonstration, we will walk you through how their random quantum\ncircuits were constructed, how the performance was measured via\ncross-entropy benchmarks, and provide reusable examples of their\nclassical simulations.\n\n> **Note**\n> \n> We will be using PennyLane along with the aformentioned `qsim` simulator\n> running via our [PennyLane-Cirq\n> plugin](https://pennylane-cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
