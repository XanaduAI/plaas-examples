Posted: 31 May 2022. Last updated: 16 June 2022.*\n\nTo create a functional quantum computer, we need to produce and control a \nlarge number of qubits. This feat has proven difficult, although significant \nprogress has been made using trapped ions, superconducting circuits, \nand many other technologies. Scalability\u2014the ability to put many \nqubits together\u2014is limited because individual qubits in a multi-qubit \nsystem lose their quantum properties quickly. This phenomenon, \nknown as decoherence, happens due to the interactions of the qubits with \ntheir surroundings. One way to get scalable structures is to \nuse photons (particles of light). The quantum states of photons\nare more robust against decoherence, so we may be onto something!\n\nIndeed, many approaches to use photons for quantum\ncomputing have been proposed. We will focus on *linear optical quantum computing*,\nan approach that has already achieved quantum advantage. It \nis being developed further by Xanadu, PsiQuantum, and other institutions\naround the globe. Unlike other physical systems, photonics allows us access to \nan infinite number of states. How can we leverage these extra states to make quantum computers? \nBy the end of this demo, you will be able to explain how photonic \ndevices can be used to build universal quantum computers. You will learn how to prepare,\nmeasure, and manipulate the quantum states of light, and how we can encode\nqubits in photons. Moreover, you will identify \nthe strengths and weaknesses of photonic devices in terms of \nDi Vincenzo's criteria, introduced in the blue box below.\n\n.. container:: alert alert-block alert-info\n    \n    **Di Vincenzo's criteria**: In the year 2000, David DiVincenzo proposed a\n    wishlist for the experimental characteristics of a quantum computer [#DiVincenzo2000]_.\n    DiVincenzo's criteria have since become the main guideline for\n    physicists and engineers building quantum computers:\n\n    1. **Well-characterized and scalable qubits**. Many of the quantum systems that \n    we find in nature are not qubits, so we must find a way to make them behave as such.\n    Moreover, we need to put many of these systems together.\n\n    2. **Qubit initialization**. We must be able to prepare the same state repeatedly within\n    an acceptable margin of error.\n\n    3. **Long coherence times**. Qubits will lose their quantum properties after\n    interacting with their environment for a while. We would like them to last long\n    enough so that we can perform quantum operations.\n\n    4. **Universal set of gates**. We need to perform arbitrary operations on the\n    qubits. To do this, we require both single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates.\n\n    5. **Measurement of individual qubits**. To read the result of a quantum algorithm,\n    we must accurately measure the final state of a pre-chosen set of qubits. \n\nOur journey will start by defining the simplest states of light, known as *Gaussian states*. We will also\ndescribe how we can perform simple gates and measurements on such states. The next step is to  \nfigure out reliable methods to generate the more general *non-Gaussian* states that are required for universal\nquantum computing. We'll see that we end up needing only \na special type of non-Gaussian states, known as GKP states. \nFinally, we will bring all the concepts together to understand how quantum algorithms\ncan be performed using these tools. Let's get started!\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Gaussian states of light\n\nWhy are the quantum states of light so durable? Photons seldom interact with each other,\nwhich means we can easily avoid uncontrolled interactions that destroy their quantum state.\nHowever, to build a universal quantum computer, we need multi-qubit gates,\nwhich means that photons must be made to communicate with each other somehow! We *can* make photons\naffect each other by using a material as a mediator. To start with, we will focus on manipulating\nphotons using *linear materials*, whose properties are unchanged when they interact with light. With linear materials,\nwe can produce a subset of the so-called **Gaussian states**. They can be fabricated with a 100% success rate\nusing common optical devices, so they are our safest tool in photonics.\n\nTo precisely define a Gaussian state, we need a mathematical representation for states\nof light. As is the case with qubits, states of light are represented by a linear\ncombination of basis vectors. But unlike qubits, two basis vectors aren't enough.\nThe reason is that light is characterized by its so-called *position and momentum quadratures* $x$ and $p,$\ncaptured by the operators $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$ respectively. Upon measurement, these quadratures\ncan take any real value, which means that $\\hat{X}$ and\n$\\hat{P}$ have infinitely many eigenvectors. Therefore, to describe a quantum of light\n$\\left\\lvert \\psi \\right\\rangle,$ we need infinitely many basis vectors!\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>The position and momentum quadratures $x$ and $p$ do not represent the position and momentum\n   of one photon. They describe the state of possibly many photons, and they are related\n   to the amplitude and phase of light. The names come from the fact that the quadrature observables $\\hat{X}$\n   and $\\hat{P}$ satisfy\n\n   .. math:: \\left[ \\hat{X},\\hat{P}\\right]=i\\hbar,\n\n   which is the same relation satisfied by conventional position and momentum in quantum mechanics. This means that\n   no simultaneous measurement of $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$ can be performed.\n   Moreover, the standard deviations of the measurements of $x$ and $p$ satisfy the\n   uncertainty relation\n\n   .. math:: \\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq 1,\n\n   where we work in units where $\\hbar = 2.$ Sometimes the word \"quadratures\" is omitted for simplicity.</p></div>\n\nFor example, we write\n\n\\begin{align}\\left\\lvert \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\int_\\mathbb{R}\\psi(x)\\vert x \\rangle dx,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\vert x \\rangle$ is the eigenstate of $\\hat{X}$ with eigenvalue\n$x,$ and $\\psi$ is a complex-valued function known as the *wave function*.\nA similar expansion can be done in terms of the eigenstates $\\vert p \\rangle$ of $\\hat{P}.$\nNote that an integral is used here rather than an infinite sum because the eigenvalues of $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$ are continuous.\nSo how do we define a Gaussian state using this representation? It is a state that is completely\ndetermined by the average values $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{p}$ of the position and momentum quadratures,\nas well as their standard deviations $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta p.$ The most trivial\nGaussian state is the *vacuum*\u2014the state with no photons. Let us see what happens if\nwe sample measurements of the quadratures $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$ when light is in the vacuum.\nWe can use PennyLane's ``default.gaussian`` device, which lets us create, manipulate, and measure Gaussian\nstates of light.

So far, we have taken for granted that we can measure the quadratures\n$\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}.$ But how do we actually measure them using optical elements?\nWe will need a measuring device known as a photodetector. These contain a piece of a\nphotoelectric material, where each outer electron can be stimulated by a photon.\nThe more photons that are incident on the photodetector, the more electrons that are\nfreed in the material, which in turn form an electric current. Mathematically,\n\n\\begin{align}I = qN,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $I$ is the electric current, $N$ is the number of photons, and $q$ is a detector-dependent\nproportionality constant [#Braunstein2005]_. Hence, measuring the current amounts to measuring the number of photons indirectly!\n\nThe number of photons in a quantum of light is not fixed. It is measured by the quantum\nphoton-number observable $\\hat{N},$ which has eigenstates denoted $\\vert 0 \\rangle, \\vert 1\\rangle, \\vert 2 \\rangle,\\dots$\nThese states, known as *Fock states*, do have a well-defined number of photons:\nrepeated measurements of $\\hat{N}$ on the same state will yield the same output.\nThe natural number $n$ in the Fock state $\\vert n \\rangle$ denotes the only possible\nresult we would get upon measuring the photon number. But nothing prevents light from being in a superposition of\nFock states. For example, when we measure $\\hat{N}$ for the state\n\n\\begin{align}\\vert \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\vert 0 \\rangle + \\vert 1 \\rangle + \\vert 2 \\rangle\\right),\\end{align}\n\nwe get 0, 1, or 2 photons, each with probability $\\frac{1}{3}.$\n\nExcept for the vacuum $\\vert 0 \\rangle,$ *Fock states are not Gaussian*. But all states of light\nare superpositions of Fock States, including Gaussian states!\nFor example, let's measure the expected photon number for some squeezed state:\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["dev3 = qml.device(\"default.gaussian\", wires=1)\n\n\n@qml.qnode(dev3)\ndef measure_n_coherent(alpha, phi):\n    qml.Squeezing(alpha, phi, wires = 0)\n    return qml.expval(qml.NumberOperator(0))\n\n\ncoherent_expval = measure_n_coherent(1, np.pi / 3)\nprint(\"Expected number of photons: {}\".format(coherent_expval))"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Since the expectation value is not an integer number, the measurement results cannot have been all the same integer.\nThis squeezed state cannot be a Fock state!\n\nBut what about the promised quadrature measurements?

Are they really different from classical states? Not that much! To build a universal photonic\nquantum computer we need both Gaussian *and* non-Gaussian states. Moreover,\nwe need to be able to entangle any two states.\n\nEntanglement is not a problem, since combinations of Gaussian operations involving\nsqueezers and beamsplitters can easily create entangled states!\nLet us set on the more challenging mission to find a way to prepare non-Gaussian states.\nAll of the operations that we have learned so far\u2014displacements, rotations, squeezing\u2014are Gaussian.\nDo we need some kind of strange material that will implement a non-Gaussian operation? That's certainly\na possibility, and there are materials which can provide non-Gaussian interactions\u2014like the `Kerr effect <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_effect>`__. But relying\non these non-linear materials is far from optimal, since the Kerr effect is weak and we don't have much freedom to manipulate\nthe setup into getting an arbitrary non-Gaussian state.\n\nBut there's one non-Gausian operation that's been right in front of our eyes all this time.\nThe measurement of the number of photons takes a Gaussian state and collapses it into a Fock state (although this destroys the photons);\ntherefore, photon-number detection is not a Gaussian operation. Measuring the exact number of photons is not that easy.\nWe need fancy devices known a photon-number resolving detectors (commonly abbreviated as PNRs),\nwhich are superconductor-based, so they work only at low temperatures. Combined with squeezed states and beamsplitters,\nwe have all the ingredients to produce non-Gaussian states.\n\nLet's explore how this works. The main idea is to tweak a particular photonic circuit known\nas a *Gaussian Boson Sampler* [#Hamilton2017]_, which is shown below.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/photonics/GBS.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 70%\n\n   ..\n\n   A Gaussian Boson Sampling circuit. The beamsplitters here may include phase shifts.\n\nGaussian boson sampling (GBS) is interesting on its own\n(see :doc:`this tutorial </demos/tutorial_gbs>` for an in-depth discussion).\nSo far, two quantum devices have used large-scale versions of this circuit\nto achieve quantum advantage on a particular computation, which involves sampling from\na probability distribution that classical computers take too long to simulate. In 2019, USTC's Jiuzhang device took 200 seconds\nto perform this sampling, which would take 2.5 billion years for some of our most powerful supercomputers [#Zhong2020]_. In 2022,\nXanadu's Borealis performed the same calculation in 36 microseconds, with the added benefit of being programmable \nand available on the Cloud [#Madsen2020]_. \n\nBut the most interesting application of GBS comes from removing the PNR in the last wire, as shown below.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/photonics/GKP_Circuit.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 70%\n\n   ..\n\n   Circuit to produce non-Gaussian states probabilistically\n\nCircuits like the above can, after photon detection of the other qumodes,\nproduce non-Gaussian states. The reason is that the\nfinal state of the circuit is entangled, and we apply a non-Gaussian operation to some of the\nqumodes. This measurement affects the remaining qumode, whose state becomes non-Gaussian in general. This is\nthe magic of quantum mechanics: due to entanglement, a measurement on a physical system can affect the state of another! Moreover,\none can show that generalizations of the GBS circuit above can be built to produce any non-Gaussian state that we want [#Tzitrin2020]_.\n\nFor example, the choice of parameters\n\n\\begin{align}t_1 = 0.8624, \\quad t_2=0.7688, \\quad t_3 = 0.7848,\\end{align}\n\\begin{align}S_1 = -1.38, \\quad S_2 = -1.22, \\quad S_3 = 0.780 \\quad S_4 = 0.196,\\end{align}\n\nfor this generalized GBS circuit produces, with some probability,  the following state (expressed as a combination of Fock states)\n\n\\begin{align}\\vert \\psi \\rangle = S(0.196)\\left(0.661 \\vert 0\\rangle -0.343 \\vert 2\\rangle + 0.253\\vert 4\\rangle -0.368\\vert 6\\rangle\n            +0.377 \\vert 8\\rangle + 0.323 \\vert 10\\rangle + 0.325\\vert 12\\rangle\\right),\\end{align}\n\nwhere $S$ is the squeezing operator [#Tzitrin2020]_. This state's\nWigner function is shown below.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/photonics/gkp_wigner.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 70%\n\n   ..\n\n   Wigner function of non-Gaussian state\n\nThis Wigner function does not have the shape of a Gaussian and moreover, it can be negative\u2014a tell-tale feature of\nnon-Gaussian states (we can only interpret the Wigner function as some sort of probability distribution for the case of Gaussian states!).\nThe only issue is that the non-Gaussian state is produced only with some probability, that is,\n*when the detectors measure some particular number of photons*. But, at the very least, we can\nbe sure that we have obtained the non-Gaussian state we wanted, and otherwise we\njust discard the qumode. For more precise calculations, you can check out `this\ntutorial <https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/gkp.html>`__ from PennyLane's sister library The Walrus,\nwhich is optimized for simulating this type of circuit.\n\n## Encoding qubits into qumodes\n\nIt's great that we can manipulate quantum states of light so freely, but we haven't discussed how\nto use them for quantum computing. We would like a way to encode qubits into qumodes, so\nthat we can run any qubit-based quantum algorithm using qumodes.\nSurely there's more than one way to encode a two-dimensional subspace into an infinite-dimensional\none. The only problem is that most of these encodings are extremely sensitive to the noise\naffecting the larger space. A way that has proven to be quite robust to errors is to\nencode qubits in states of light is using a special type of non-Gaussian states called *GKP states* [#Gottesman2001]_.\n\nGKP states are linear combinations of the following two basis states:\n\n\\begin{align}\\vert 0 \\rangle_{GKP} = \\sum_{n} \\vert 2n\\pi\\rangle_x,\\end{align}\n\\begin{align}\\vert 1 \\rangle_{GKP} = \\sum_{n} \\vert (2n+1)\\pi\\rangle_x,\\end{align}\n\nwhere the subscript $x$ means that the kets in the sum are eigenstates of the quadrature observable\n$\\hat{X}.$ Therefore, an arbitrary qubit $\\vert \\psi \\rangle = \\alpha\\vert 0 \\rangle + \\beta\\vert 1 \\rangle$\ncan be expressed through the qumode as\n\n\\begin{align}\\vert \\psi \\rangle_{GKP} = \\alpha\\vert 0 \\rangle_{GKP} + \\beta\\vert 1 \\rangle_{GKP}.\\end{align}\n\nThe only problem is that producing these GKP states is physically impossible, doing so would require infinite energy.\nInstead, we can produce approximate versions of them and still\nrun a quantum computation with great precision. In fact, the GBS circuit we built to produce non-Gaussian states can also produce\napproximate GKP states. This will only happen when we measure 5 and 7 photons in each of the detectors [#Tzitrin2020]_. The probability of this happening\nis rather small but finite.\n\nWe can remain within the subspace spanned by the GKP basis states by restricting the operations we apply\non our qumodes. For example, we see that applying a displacement by $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ to $\\vert 0 \\rangle_{GKP}$ gives the\n$\\vert 1 \\rangle_{GKP}$ state, and vice versa. Therefore, the displacement operator corresponds to the qubit\nbit-flip gate :class:`~pennylane.PauliX`. Similarly, a rotation operator by $\\pi/2$ implements the :class:`~pennylane.Hadamard` gate.\nThe table below gives more detail on how to implement all the gates we need for\nuniversal quantum computation using optical gates on  exact GKP states [#Bourassa2021]_ (on approximate GKP states, the effects of these\ngates will be approximate on the qubit level).\n\n\n.. rst-class:: docstable\n\n    +---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n    | .. centered::       | .. centered::                                                | .. centered::                                                       |\n    |  Qumode Gate        |  Optical Diagram                                             |  Qubit gate on GKP states                                           |\n    +=====================+==============================================================+=====================================================================+\n    | Displacement        | .. figure:: ../demonstrations/photonics/Displacement.png     | *Pauli X* gate if the displacement is by $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ in      |\n    |                     |    :align: center                                            | the $x$-direction. *Pauli Z* if the same displacement is      |\n    |                     |    :width: 70%                                               | in the $p$-direction                                          |\n    +---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n    | Rotation            | .. figure:: ../demonstrations/photonics/Rotation.png         | *Hadamard* gate for $\\phi=\\frac{\\pi}{2}.$                     |\n    |                     |    :align: center                                            |                                                                     |\n    |                     |    :width: 70%                                               |                                                                     |\n    +---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n    | Continuous variable | .. figure:: ../demonstrations/photonics/CV_ctrlz.png         | The squeezing parameter is given by $r=\\sinh^{-1}(1/2)$ and   |\n    | CNOT                |    :align: center                                            | the beamsplitters have $T=\\frac{1}{4}(1-\\tanh(r)).$           |\n    |                     |    :width: 100%                                              | Applies a *Control-Z* operation on the GKP states when              |\n    |                     |                                                              | $\\phi = 0$ and a *CNOT* operation when $\\phi=\\pi/2.$    |\n    |                     |                                                              |                                                                     |\n    |                     |                                                              |                                                                     |\n    |                     |                                                              |                                                                     |\n    +---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n    | Magic state         | .. figure:: ../demonstrations/photonics/Tgate.png            | We use an auxiliary *magic state* $\\vert M\\rangle,$           |\n    | teleportation       |    :align: center                                            | which is the GKP state                                              |\n    |                     |    :width: 100%                                              | $\\vert M\\rangle = \\vert +\\rangle +e^{i\\pi/4} \\vert -\\rangle,$ |\n    |                     |                                                              | and a $\\hat{P}$ homodyne measurement.

Therefore, we have all the ingredients to build a universal\nquantum computer using photons, summarized in the formula (see `this medium article <https://medium.com/xanaduai/riding-bosonic-qubits-towards-fault-tolerant-quantum-computation-95b92c78cb43>`__):\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/photonics/formula_qc.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 70%\n\n## The state of the art\n\nWe have now learned the basics of how to build a quantum computer using photonics. So what challenges\nare there to overcome for scaling further?\nLet us analyze what we have learned in terms of Di Vincenzo's criteria, so we can understand\nwhat Xanadu is doing to achieve the ambitious goal of building a million-qubit quantum computer. \n\nLooking at the first criterion, we already know that our qubits are far from perfect.\nPhotonics rely on imperfect realizations of GKP states, which in turn makes quantum computations only approximate.\nMoreover, while we know a lot about GKP states, it is not easy to characterize them after taking into account the noise,\nso the qubits are not as well-defined as we would like. But our qubits are scalable: GBS circuits can be built on\nsmall chips, which we can stack and connect together using optical fibers. Moreover, compared to other implementations where\nlow temperatures are needed everywhere, in photonic quantum computers we only need them for the PNRs to work.\nSince cryogenics are a bulky part of quantum computing architectures, photonic technology promises to be more scalable than, for example,\n:doc:`trapped ion </demos/tutorial_trapped_ions>` or :doc:`superconducting </demos/tutorial_sc_qubits>` devices.\n\nThe second criterion, the ability to prepare a qubit, is clearly a challenge. We need GKP states,\nbut these cannot be prepared deterministically; we need to get a bit lucky.\nWe can bypass this by *multiplexing*, that is, using many\nGaussian Boson Sampling circuits in parallel. Moreover, higher-quality GKP states need larger circuits,\nwhich in turn can decrease the probability of qubit production. How can we try to solve this?\nXanadu is currently following a hybrid approach.\nWhen we fail to produce a GKP state, Xanadu's architecture produces squeezed states using a separate squeezer.\nStrongly-entangled squeezed states are a precious resource, since other encodings beyond GKP allow us\nto use these states as a resource for (non-universal) quantum computing [#Bourassa2021]_.\n\nThe third criterion of long decoherence times seems innocuous at a first glance. However, although the quantum state of individual photons\nis robust, we do need to minimize the number of photons that escape to the environment. Recall that all quantum states\nof light are superpositions of Fock states. If a photon escapes, our state changes! The technology for the minimization of photon loss\nhas come a long way, but it's not perfect yet. We can avoid losses by optimizing the depth of our circuits, so that photons\nhave a smaller probability of escaping. The GKP encoding also works in our favour, since it is robust against noise and small\ndisplacements from GKP states can be easily steered back.\n\nThe fourth criterion is pretty much satisfied by photonic quantum computers. We have seen that we can perform universal computations\nusing Gaussian operations, provided that we have GKP states. Barring our imperfect qubits, quantum computing\ngates are straightforward to implement with good precision inside a chip. Moreover, entangling photons is relatively easy using\ncommon optical devices, as opposed to other technologies that rely on rather complicated and slow gates.\n\nFinally, we need to be able to measure qubits. Homodyne detection can be done easily and with great precision. In general,\nwe do not need to measure the number of photons at the end of a quantum computation, quadrature measurement is enough to distinguish quantum\nstates. The fancy PNRs are only required for qubit production!\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/photonics/chip.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 40%\n\n   ..\n\n   Xanadu's X8 Gaussian Boson Sampling chip. Variants of this chip can be used to generate approximate GKP states.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe approach of photonic devices to quantum computing is quite different from other technologies. Recent theoretical\nand technological developments have given a boost to their status as a scalable approach, although the generation of qubits\nremains a challenge to overcome. The variety of ways that we can encode\nqubits into photonic states leave plenty of room for creativity, and opens the\ndoor for further research and engineering breakthroughs.
