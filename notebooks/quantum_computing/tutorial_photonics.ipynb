Posted: 31 May 2022. Last updated: 16 June\n2022.*\n\nTo create a functional quantum computer, we need to produce and control\na large number of qubits. This feat has proven difficult, although\nsignificant progress has been made using trapped ions, superconducting\ncircuits, and many other technologies. Scalability---the ability to put\nmany qubits together---is limited because individual qubits in a\nmulti-qubit system lose their quantum properties quickly. This\nphenomenon, known as decoherence, happens due to the interactions of the\nqubits with their surroundings. One way to get scalable structures is to\nuse photons (particles of light). The quantum states of photons are more\nrobust against decoherence, so we may be onto something!\n\nIndeed, many approaches to use photons for quantum computing have been\nproposed. We will focus on *linear optical quantum computing*, an\napproach that has already achieved quantum advantage. It is being\ndeveloped further by Xanadu, PsiQuantum, and other institutions around\nthe globe. Unlike other physical systems, photonics allows us access to\nan infinite number of states. How can we leverage these extra states to\nmake quantum computers? By the end of this demo, you will be able to\nexplain how photonic devices can be used to build universal quantum\ncomputers. You will learn how to prepare, measure, and manipulate the\nquantum states of light, and how we can encode qubits in photons.\nMoreover, you will identify the strengths and weaknesses of photonic\ndevices in terms of Di Vincenzo\\'s criteria, introduced in the blue box\nbelow.\n\n> **Di Vincenzo\\'s criteria**: In the year 2000, David DiVincenzo proposed\n> a wishlist for the experimental characteristics of a quantum computer.\n> DiVincenzo\\'s criteria have since become the main guideline for\n> physicists and engineers building quantum computers:\n> \n> 1\\. **Well-characterized and scalable qubits**.

To read the result of a quantum\n> algorithm, we must accurately measure the final state of a pre-chosen\n> set of qubits.\n\n\n\nOur journey will start by defining the simplest states of light, known\nas *Gaussian states*. We will also describe how we can perform simple\ngates and measurements on such states. The next step is to figure out\nreliable methods to generate the more general *non-Gaussian* states that\nare required for universal quantum computing. We\\'ll see that we end up\nneeding only a special type of non-Gaussian states, known as GKP states.\nFinally, we will bring all the concepts together to understand how\nquantum algorithms can be performed using these tools. Let\\'s get\nstarted!\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Gaussian states of light\n========================\n\nWhy are the quantum states of light so durable? Photons seldom interact\nwith each other, which means we can easily avoid uncontrolled\ninteractions that destroy their quantum state. However, to build a\nuniversal quantum computer, we need multi-qubit gates, which means that\nphotons must be made to communicate with each other somehow! We *can*\nmake photons affect each other by using a material as a mediator. To\nstart with, we will focus on manipulating photons using *linear\nmaterials*, whose properties are unchanged when they interact with\nlight. With linear materials, we can produce a subset of the so-called\n**Gaussian states**. They can be fabricated with a 100% success rate\nusing common optical devices, so they are our safest tool in photonics.\n\nTo precisely define a Gaussian state, we need a mathematical\nrepresentation for states of light. As is the case with qubits, states\nof light are represented by a linear combination of basis vectors. But\nunlike qubits, two basis vectors aren\\'t enough. The reason is that\nlight is characterized by its so-called *position and momentum\nquadratures* $x$ and $p,$ captured by the operators $\\hat{X}$ and\n$\\hat{P}$ respectively. Upon measurement, these quadratures can take any\nreal value, which means that $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$ have infinitely\nmany eigenvectors. Therefore, to describe a quantum of light\n$\\left\\lvert \\psi \\right\\rangle,$ we need infinitely many basis vectors!\n\n> **Note**\n> \n> The position and momentum quadratures $x$ and $p$ do not represent the\n> position and momentum of one photon. They describe the state of possibly\n> many photons, and they are related to the amplitude and phase of light.\n> The names come from the fact that the quadrature observables $\\hat{X}$\n> and $\\hat{P}$ satisfy\n> \n> $$\\left[ \\hat{X},\\hat{P}\\right]=i\\hbar,$$\n> \n> which is the same relation satisfied by conventional position and\n> momentum in quantum mechanics. This means that no simultaneous\n> measurement of $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$ can be performed. Moreover, the\n> standard deviations of the measurements of $x$ and $p$ satisfy the\n> uncertainty relation\n> \n> $$\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq 1,$$\n> \n> where we work in units where $\\hbar = 2.$ Sometimes the word\n> \\\"quadratures\\\" is omitted for simplicity.\n\n\n\nFor example, we write\n\n$$\\left\\lvert \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\int_\\mathbb{R}\\psi(x)\\vert x \\rangle dx,$$\n\nwhere $\\vert x \\rangle$ is the eigenstate of $\\hat{X}$ with eigenvalue\n$x,$ and $\\psi$ is a complex-valued function known as the *wave\nfunction*. A similar expansion can be done in terms of the eigenstates\n$\\vert p \\rangle$ of $\\hat{P}.$ Note that an integral is used here\nrather than an infinite sum because the eigenvalues of $\\hat{X}$ and\n$\\hat{P}$ are continuous. So how do we define a Gaussian state using\nthis representation? It is a state that is completely determined by the\naverage values $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{p}$ of the position and momentum\nquadratures, as well as their standard deviations $\\Delta x$ and\n$\\Delta p.$ The most trivial Gaussian state is the *vacuum*---the state\nwith no photons. Let us see what happens if we sample measurements of\nthe quadratures $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$ when light is in the vacuum. We\ncan use PennyLane\\'s `default.gaussian` device, which lets us create,\nmanipulate, and measure Gaussian states of light.

So far, we have taken for granted that we\ncan measure the quadratures $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}.$ But how do we\nactually measure them using optical elements? We will need a measuring\ndevice known as a photodetector. These contain a piece of a\nphotoelectric material, where each outer electron can be stimulated by a\nphoton. The more photons that are incident on the photodetector, the\nmore electrons that are freed in the material, which in turn form an\nelectric current. Mathematically,\n\n$$I = qN,$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the electric current, $N$ is the number of photons, and $q$\nis a detector-dependent proportionality constant. Hence, measuring the\ncurrent amounts to measuring the number of photons indirectly!\n\nThe number of photons in a quantum of light is not fixed. It is measured\nby the quantum photon-number observable $\\hat{N},$ which has eigenstates\ndenoted $\\vert 0 \\rangle, \\vert 1\\rangle, \\vert 2 \\rangle,\\dots$ These\nstates, known as *Fock states*, do have a well-defined number of\nphotons: repeated measurements of $\\hat{N}$ on the same state will yield\nthe same output. The natural number $n$ in the Fock state\n$\\vert n \\rangle$ denotes the only possible result we would get upon\nmeasuring the photon number. But nothing prevents light from being in a\nsuperposition of Fock states. For example, when we measure $\\hat{N}$ for\nthe state\n\n$$\\vert \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\vert 0 \\rangle + \\vert 1 \\rangle + \\vert 2 \\rangle\\right),$$\n\nwe get 0, 1, or 2 photons, each with probability $\\frac{1}{3}.$\n\nExcept for the vacuum $\\vert 0 \\rangle,$ *Fock states are not Gaussian*.\nBut all states of light are superpositions of Fock States, including\nGaussian states!

They are described by their positive\nWigner function, which is to an extent analogous to a probability\ndistribution. Are they really different from classical states? Not that\nmuch! To build a universal photonic quantum computer we need both\nGaussian *and* non-Gaussian states. Moreover, we need to be able to\nentangle any two states.\n\nEntanglement is not a problem, since combinations of Gaussian operations\ninvolving squeezers and beamsplitters can easily create entangled\nstates! Let us set on the more challenging mission to find a way to\nprepare non-Gaussian states. All of the operations that we have learned\nso far---displacements, rotations, squeezing---are Gaussian. Do we need\nsome kind of strange material that will implement a non-Gaussian\noperation? That\\'s certainly a possibility, and there are materials\nwhich can provide non-Gaussian interactions---like the [Kerr\neffect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_effect). But relying on these\nnon-linear materials is far from optimal, since the Kerr effect is weak\nand we don\\'t have much freedom to manipulate the setup into getting an\narbitrary non-Gaussian state.\n\nBut there\\'s one non-Gausian operation that\\'s been right in front of\nour eyes all this time. The measurement of the number of photons takes a\nGaussian state and collapses it into a Fock state (although this\ndestroys the photons); therefore, photon-number detection is not a\nGaussian operation. Measuring the exact number of photons is not that\neasy. We need fancy devices known a photon-number resolving detectors\n(commonly abbreviated as PNRs), which are superconductor-based, so they\nwork only at low temperatures. Combined with squeezed states and\nbeamsplitters, we have all the ingredients to produce non-Gaussian\nstates.\n\nLet\\'s explore how this works. The main idea is to tweak a particular\nphotonic circuit known as a *Gaussian Boson Sampler*[^1], which is shown\nbelow.\n\n![..](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/GBS.png)\n\nA Gaussian Boson Sampling circuit. The beamsplitters here may include\nphase shifts.\n\nGaussian boson sampling (GBS) is interesting on its own (see\n[this tutorial](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_gbs.html) for\nan in-depth discussion). So far, two quantum devices have used\nlarge-scale versions of this circuit to achieve quantum advantage on a\nparticular computation, which involves sampling from a probability\ndistribution that classical computers take too long to simulate. In\n2019, USTC\\'s Jiuzhang device took 200 seconds to perform this sampling,\nwhich would take 2.5 billion years for some of our most powerful\nsupercomputers[^2]. In 2022, Xanadu\\'s Borealis performed the same\ncalculation in 36 microseconds, with the added benefit of being\nprogrammable and available on the Cloud[^3].\n\nBut the most interesting application of GBS comes from removing the PNR\nin the last wire, as shown below.\n\n![..](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/GKP_Circuit.png)\n\nCircuit to produce non-Gaussian states probabilistically\n\nCircuits like the above can, after photon detection of the other\nqumodes, produce non-Gaussian states. The reason is that the final state\nof the circuit is entangled, and we apply a non-Gaussian operation to\nsome of the qumodes. This measurement affects the remaining qumode,\nwhose state becomes non-Gaussian in general. This is the magic of\nquantum mechanics: due to entanglement, a measurement on a physical\nsystem can affect the state of another! Moreover, one can show that\ngeneralizations of the GBS circuit above can be built to produce any\nnon-Gaussian state that we want[^4].\n\nFor example, the choice of parameters\n\n$$t_1 = 0.8624, \\quad t_2=0.7688, \\quad t_3 = 0.7848,$$\n\n$$S_1 = -1.38, \\quad S_2 = -1.22, \\quad S_3 = 0.780 \\quad S_4 = 0.196,$$\n\nfor this generalized GBS circuit produces, with some probability, the\nfollowing state (expressed as a combination of Fock states)\n\n$$\\vert \\psi \\rangle = S(0.196)\\left(0.661 \\vert 0\\rangle -0.343 \\vert 2\\rangle + 0.253\\vert 4\\rangle -0.368\\vert 6\\rangle\n+0.377 \\vert 8\\rangle + 0.323 \\vert 10\\rangle + 0.325\\vert 12\\rangle\\right),$$\n\nwhere $S$ is the squeezing operator[^5]. This state\\'s Wigner function\nis shown below.\n\n![..](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/gkp_wigner.png)\n\nWigner function of non-Gaussian state\n\nThis Wigner function does not have the shape of a Gaussian and moreover,\nit can be negative---a tell-tale feature of non-Gaussian states (we can\nonly interpret the Wigner function as some sort of probability\ndistribution for the case of Gaussian states!). The only issue is that\nthe non-Gaussian state is produced only with some probability, that is,\n*when the detectors measure some particular number of photons*. But, at\nthe very least, we can be sure that we have obtained the non-Gaussian\nstate we wanted, and otherwise we just discard the qumode. For more\nprecise calculations, you can check out [this\ntutorial](https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/gkp.html)\nfrom PennyLane\\'s sister library The Walrus, which is optimized for\nsimulating this type of circuit.\n\nEncoding qubits into qumodes\n============================\n\nIt\\'s great that we can manipulate quantum states of light so freely,\nbut we haven\\'t discussed how to use them for quantum computing. We\nwould like a way to encode qubits into qumodes, so that we can run any\nqubit-based quantum algorithm using qumodes. Surely there\\'s more than\none way to encode a two-dimensional subspace into an\ninfinite-dimensional one. The only problem is that most of these\nencodings are extremely sensitive to the noise affecting the larger\nspace. A way that has proven to be quite robust to errors is to encode\nqubits in states of light is using a special type of non-Gaussian states\ncalled *GKP states*[^6].\n\nGKP states are linear combinations of the following two basis states:\n\n$$\\vert 0 \\rangle_{GKP} = \\sum_{n} \\vert 2n\\pi\\rangle_x,$$\n\n$$\\vert 1 \\rangle_{GKP} = \\sum_{n} \\vert (2n+1)\\pi\\rangle_x,$$\n\nwhere the subscript $x$ means that the kets in the sum are eigenstates\nof the quadrature observable $\\hat{X}.$ Therefore, an arbitrary qubit\n$\\vert \\psi \\rangle = \\alpha\\vert 0 \\rangle + \\beta\\vert 1 \\rangle$ can\nbe expressed through the qumode as\n\n$$\\vert \\psi \\rangle_{GKP} = \\alpha\\vert 0 \\rangle_{GKP} + \\beta\\vert 1 \\rangle_{GKP}.$$\n\nThe only problem is that producing these GKP states is physically\nimpossible, doing so would require infinite energy. Instead, we can\nproduce approximate versions of them and still run a quantum computation\nwith great precision. In fact, the GBS circuit we built to produce\nnon-Gaussian states can also produce approximate GKP states. This will\nonly happen when we measure 5 and 7 photons in each of the\ndetectors[^7]. The probability of this happening is rather small but\nfinite.\n\nWe can remain within the subspace spanned by the GKP basis states by\nrestricting the operations we apply on our qumodes. For example, we see\nthat applying a displacement by $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ to $\\vert 0 \\rangle_{GKP}$\ngives the $\\vert 1 \\rangle_{GKP}$ state, and vice versa. Therefore, the\ndisplacement operator corresponds to the qubit bit-flip gate\n`PauliX`. Similarly, a\nrotation operator by $\\pi/2$ implements the\n`Hadamard` gate. The table\nbelow gives more detail on how to implement all the gates we need for\nuniversal quantum computation using optical gates on exact GKP\nstates[^8] (on approximate GKP states, the effects of these gates will\nbe approximate on the qubit level).\n\n+---------+----------------------------+-------------------------------+\n| ::: {.c | ::: {.centered}            | ::: {.centered}               |\n| entered | :::                        | :::                           |\n| }       |                            |                               |\n| :::     | Optical Diagram            | Qubit gate on GKP states      |\n|         |                            |                               |\n| Qumode  |                            |                               |\n| Gate    |                            |                               |\n+=========+============================+===============================+\n| Displac | ![](../demonstrations/phot | *Pauli X* gate if the         |\n| ement   | onics/Displacement.png){.a | displacement is by            |\n|         | lign-center                | $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ in the           |\n|         | width=\"70.0%\"}             | $x$-direction. *Pauli Z* if   |\n|         |                            | the same displacement is in   |\n|         |                            | the $p$-direction             |\n+---------+----------------------------+-------------------------------+\n| Rotatio | ![](../demonstrations/phot | *Hadamard* gate for           |\n| n       | onics/Rotation.png){.align | $\\phi=\\frac{\\pi}{2}.$         |\n|         | -center                    |                               |\n|         | width=\"70.0%\"}             |                               |\n+---------+----------------------------+-------------------------------+\n| Continu | ![](../demonstrations/phot | The squeezing parameter is    |\n| ous     | onics/CV_ctrlz.png){.align | given by $r=\\sinh^{-1}(1/2)$  |\n| variabl | -center                    | and the beamsplitters have    |\n| e       | width=\"100.0%\"}            | $T=\\frac{1}{4}(1-\\tanh(r)).$  |\n| CNOT    |                            | Applies a *Control-Z*         |\n|         |                            | operation on the GKP states   |\n|         |                            | when $\\phi = 0$ and a *CNOT*  |\n|         |                            | operation when $\\phi=\\pi/2.$  |\n+---------+----------------------------+-------------------------------+\n| Magic   | ![](../demonstrations/phot | We use an auxiliary *magic    |\n| state   | onics/Tgate.png)            | $\\vert M\\rangle = \\vert +\\ran |\n|         |                            | gle +e^{i\\pi/4} \\vert -\\rangl |\n|         |                            | e,$                           |\n|         |                            | and a $\\hat{P}$ homodyne      |\n|         |                            | measurement.

Therefore, we\nhave all the ingredients to build a universal quantum computer using\nphotons, summarized in the formula (see [this medium\narticle](https://medium.com/xanaduai/riding-bosonic-qubits-towards-fault-tolerant-quantum-computation-95b92c78cb43)):\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/formula_qc.png)\n\nThe state of the art\n====================\n\nWe have now learned the basics of how to build a quantum computer using\nphotonics. So what challenges are there to overcome for scaling further?\nLet us analyze what we have learned in terms of Di Vincenzo\\'s criteria,\nso we can understand what Xanadu is doing to achieve the ambitious goal\nof building a million-qubit quantum computer.\n\nLooking at the first criterion, we already know that our qubits are far\nfrom perfect. Photonics rely on imperfect realizations of GKP states,\nwhich in turn makes quantum computations only approximate. Moreover,\nwhile we know a lot about GKP states, it is not easy to characterize\nthem after taking into account the noise, so the qubits are not as\nwell-defined as we would like. But our qubits are scalable: GBS circuits\ncan be built on small chips, which we can stack and connect together\nusing optical fibers. Moreover, compared to other implementations where\nlow temperatures are needed everywhere, in photonic quantum computers we\nonly need them for the PNRs to work. Since cryogenics are a bulky part\nof quantum computing architectures, photonic technology promises to be\nmore scalable than, for example,\n[trapped ion](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_trapped_ions.html) or\n[superconducting](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_sc_qubits.html) devices.\n\nThe second criterion, the ability to prepare a qubit, is clearly a\nchallenge. We need GKP states, but these cannot be prepared\ndeterministically; we need to get a bit lucky. We can bypass this by\n*multiplexing*, that is, using many Gaussian Boson Sampling circuits in\nparallel. Moreover, higher-quality GKP states need larger circuits,\nwhich in turn can decrease the probability of qubit production. How can\nwe try to solve this? Xanadu is currently following a hybrid approach.\nWhen we fail to produce a GKP state, Xanadu\\'s architecture produces\nsqueezed states using a separate squeezer. Strongly-entangled squeezed\nstates are a precious resource, since other encodings beyond GKP allow\nus to use these states as a resource for (non-universal) quantum\ncomputing[^9].\n\nThe third criterion of long decoherence times seems innocuous at a first\nglance. However, although the quantum state of individual photons is\nrobust, we do need to minimize the number of photons that escape to the\nenvironment. Recall that all quantum states of light are superpositions\nof Fock states. If a photon escapes, our state changes! The technology\nfor the minimization of photon loss has come a long way, but it\\'s not\nperfect yet. We can avoid losses by optimizing the depth of our\ncircuits, so that photons have a smaller probability of escaping. The\nGKP encoding also works in our favour, since it is robust against noise\nand small displacements from GKP states can be easily steered back.\n\nThe fourth criterion is pretty much satisfied by photonic quantum\ncomputers. We have seen that we can perform universal computations using\nGaussian operations, provided that we have GKP states. Barring our\nimperfect qubits, quantum computing gates are straightforward to\nimplement with good precision inside a chip. Moreover, entangling\nphotons is relatively easy using common optical devices, as opposed to\nother technologies that rely on rather complicated and slow gates.\n\nFinally, we need to be able to measure qubits. Homodyne detection can be\ndone easily and with great precision. In general, we do not need to\nmeasure the number of photons at the end of a quantum computation,\nquadrature measurement is enough to distinguish quantum states. The\nfancy PNRs are only required for qubit production!\n\n![..](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/chip.png)\n\nXanadu\\'s X8 Gaussian Boson Sampling chip. Variants of this chip can be\nused to generate approximate GKP states.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nThe approach of photonic devices to quantum computing is quite different\nfrom other technologies. Recent theoretical and technological\ndevelopments have given a boost to their status as a scalable approach,\nalthough the generation of qubits remains a challenge to overcome. The\nvariety of ways that we can encode qubits into photonic states leave\nplenty of room for creativity, and opens the door for further research\nand engineering breakthroughs.
