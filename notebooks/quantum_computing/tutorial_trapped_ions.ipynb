Posted: 10 November 2021. Last updated: 10 November 2021.*\n\nThe race for quantum advantage is on! \nA host of competitors are using different technologies to build a useful quantum\ncomputer. Some common approaches are **trapped ions,\nsuperconducting circuits**, and **photons**, among others. Discussing whether there\nis a superior framework leads to a neverending debate. All of them pose\ncomplex technological challenges, which we can only solve through\ninnovation, inventiveness, hard work, and a bit of luck. It is difficult\nto predict whether these problems are solvable in a given timeframe.\nMore often than not, our predictions have been wrong. Forecasting the winner\nof this race is not easy at all!\n\nHere, we introduce **trapped ion quantum\ncomputers**. It is the preferred technology that research groups use at\nseveral universities around the world, and at research companies like\nHoneywell and IonQ. In particular, Honeywell has achieved a `quantum\nvolume <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/quantum_volume.html>`_\nof 128, the largest in the market! As the name suggests, the\nqubits are ions trapped by electric fields and manipulated with lasers.\nTrapped ions have relatively long coherence times, which means that the qubits are\nlong-lived. Moreover, they can easily interact with their neighbours. \nScalability is a challenge, but, as we will see, there are\ninnovative ways to get around them.\n\nAfter reading this demo, you will learn how trapped ion quantum computers\nprepare, evolve, and measure quantum states. In particular, you will gain \nknowledge on how single and multi-qubit gates are implemented and how we can \nsimulate them using PennyLane. You will also identify the features that\nmake trapped ion quantum computers an appropriate physical implementation, and where the \ntechnical challenges lie, in terms of **DiVincenzo's criteria** (see box below). \nFinally, you will become familiar with the concepts required to understand recent articles on the topic \nand read future papers to keep up-to-date with the most recent developments.\n\n.. container:: alert alert-block alert-info\n    \n    **Di Vincenzo's criteria**: In the year 2000, David DiVincenzo proposed a\n    wishlist for the experimental characteristics of a quantum computer [#DiVincenzo2000]_.\n    DiVincenzo's criteria have since become the main guideline for\n    physicists and engineers building quantum computers:\n\n    1. **Well-characterized and scalable qubits**. Many of the quantum systems that \n    we find in nature are not qubits, so we must find a way to make them behave as such.\n    Moreover, we need to put many of these systems together.\n\n    2. **Qubit initialization**. We must be able to prepare the same state repeatedly within\n    an acceptable margin of error.\n\n    3. **Long coherence times**. Qubits will lose their quantum properties after\n    interacting with their environment for a while. We would like them to last long\n    enough so that we can perform quantum operations.\n\n    4. **Universal set of gates**. We need to perform arbitrary operations on the\n    qubits. To do this, we require both single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates.\n\n    5. **Measurement of individual qubits**. To read the result of a quantum algorithm,\n    we must accurately measure the final state of a pre-chosen set of qubits. \n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["How to trap an ion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhy do we use ions, i.e., charged atoms, as qubits? The main reason\nis that they can be contained (that is, trapped) in one precise location using electric fields. It is\npossible to contain neutral atoms using optical tweezers, but our focus\nis on ions, which can be contained using an electromagnetic trap. Ion traps\nare rather old technology: their history goes back to 1953 when Wolfgang\nPaul proposed his now-called Paul trap [#Paul1953]_. For this invention, Paul and\nDehmelt were awarded the 1989 Physics Nobel Prize, since it is used to make highly\nprecise atomic clocks. Current trapped ion quantum computers extensively\nuse the Paul trap, but Paul won the prize six years before such an\napplication was proposed [#CiracZoller]_!\n\nIt is not easy to create electric fields that contain the ion in a tiny\nregion of space. The ideal configuration of an electric field \n\u2014also known as a *potential*\u2014 would look like this:\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/confining.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 70%\n\n   ..\n\n   Confining potential\n\nThe potential should be interpreted as a wall that the ion must climb\nover to escape from a physical region. Positively charged ions will always roll\ndown from regions of high potential to low potential. So if we can\nachieve an electric potential like the above, the ion should remain\ntrapped in the pit. However, using the laws of electrostatics, we can\nshow that it is impossible to create a confining potential with only\nstatic electric fields. Instead, they produce saddle-shaped potentials:\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/saddle_potential.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 70%\n\n   ..\n\n   Saddle-shaped potential allowed by electrostatics\n\nThis potential is problematic since the ion is contained in one\ndirection but could escape in the perpendicular direction. Therefore,\nthe solution is to use time-dependent electric fields to allow the\npotential wall to move. What would happen, for example, if we rotated\nthe potential plotted above? We can imagine that if the saddle potential\nrotates at a specific frequency, the wall will catch the ion as it tries\nto escape in the downhill direction. Explicitly, the electric potential\nthat we generate is given by [#Malinowski]_\n\n\\begin{align}\\Phi = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(u_x x^2 + u_y y^2 + u_z z^2\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(v_x x^2 + v_y y^2 + v_z z^2\\right)\\cos(\\omega t+\\phi).\\end{align}\n\nThe parameters $u_i$, $v_i$, and $\\phi$ need to be\nadjusted to the charge and mass of the ion and to the potential's\nangular frequency $\\omega$. We have to tune these\nparameters very carefully, since the ion could escape if we do not apply\nthe right forces at the right time. It takes a lot of care, but this\ntechnique is so old that it is almost perfect by now. Here is what the\nrotating potential would look like:\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/Rotating.gif\n    :align: center\n    :width: 70%\n\n    ..\n\n    A rotating potential with the correct frequency and magnitude\n    can contain an ion\n\nWe want to make a quantum computer, so having one qubit cannot be\nenough. We would like as many as we can possibly afford! The good news\nis that we have the technology to trap many ions and put them close\ntogether in a one-dimensional array, called an ion chain. Why do we need\nthis particular configuration? To manipulate the qubits, we need the\nsystem of ions to absorb photons. However, shooting a photon at an ion\ncan cause relative motion between ions. The\nproximity between qubits will cause unwanted interactions, which could\nmodify their state. Happily, there is a solution to this issue: we place\nthe ions in a sufficiently spaced one-dimensional array and **cool them\nall down to the point where their motion in space is quantized**. In\nthis scenario, photons that would bring the ion to their excited states\nwill not cause any relative motion. Instead, all ions will recoil\ntogether [#NandC2000]_. This phenomenon is called the **Mossbauer effect**. We will\nsee later that by carefully tuning the laser frequency, we can control\nboth the excitations of the ions and the motion of the ion chain. This\nuser-controlled motion is precisely what we need to perform quantum\noperations with two qubits.\n\nTrapped ions as robust qubits\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nNow that we know how to trap ions, we would like to use them as qubits.\nWould any ion out there work well as a qubit? In fact, only a select few\nisotopes will do the trick. The reason is that our qubit basis states\nare the ground and excited states of an electron in the atom, and we\nneed to be able to transition between them using laser light. Therefore,\nwe would like the atom to have an excited state that is long-lived, and\nalso one that we may manipulate using frequencies that lasers can\nproduce. Thanks to semiconductor laser technology, we have a wide range\nof frequencies that we can use in the visible and infrared ranges, so\ngetting the desired frequency is not too much of a problem. The best\nions for our purposes are single-charged ions in Group II of the\nperiodic table, such as Calcium-40, Beryllium-9, and Barium-138,\ncommonly used in university laboratories [#Bergou2021]_. The rare earth Ytterbium-171 is\nused by IonQ and Honeywell. These elements have two *valence electrons*,\nbut their ionized version only has one. The valence electron is not so\ntightly bound to the atom, so it is the one whose state we use to represent a\nqubit.\n\n.. container:: alert alert-block alert-info\n\n   **Atomic Physics Primer:** Atoms consist of a positively charged nucleus\n   and negative electrons around them. The electrons inhabit energy\n   levels, which have a population limit. As the levels fill up, the\n   electrons occupy higher and higher energy levels. But as long as\n   there is space, electrons can change energy levels, with a preference\n   for the lower ones. This can happen spontaneously or due to external\n   influences.\n\n   When the lower energy levels are not occupied, the higher energy levels\n   are unstable: electrons will prefer to minimize their energy and jump to\n   a lower level on their own. What happens when an electron jumps from\n   a high energy level to a lower one? Conservation of energy tells us\n   that the energy must go somewhere. Indeed, a photon with an energy\n   equal to the energy lost by the electron is emitted. This energy is\n   proportional to the frequency (colour) of the photon.\n\n   Conversely, we can use laser light to induce the opposite process.\n   When an electron is in a stable or ground state, we can use lasers\n   with their frequency set roughly to the difference\n   in energy levels, or energy gap, between the ground state and an\n   excited state . If a photon hits an electron, it will go to that\n   higher energy state. When the light stimulus is removed, the excited\n   electrons will return to stable states. The time it takes them to do\n   so depends on the particular excited state they are in since,\n   sometimes, the laws of physics will make it harder for electrons to\n   jump back on their own.\n\n   .. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/atomic.png\n      :align: center\n      :width: 60%\n\n      ..\n\n      Photons with an energy equal to the atomic gap drive excitations\n\n\nHaving chosen the ions that will act as our qubits, we need to prepare\nthem in a stable fiducial state, known as the **ground state** and\ndenoted by $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$. The preparation is done\nby a procedure called **optical pumping**. To understand how it works, let us\ntake Calcium-40 as an example. In this case, the electron has two stable\nstates with the same energy, but different direction of rotation.\nWe denote these by $\\left\\lvert g_1 \\right\\rangle$ and\n$\\left\\lvert g_2\\right\\rangle$. We do not know which stable state\nthe electron is in, and we would like to ensure that the electron is in\nthe $\\left\\lvert g_1\\right\\rangle$ state. This will be our chosen\nfiducial state, so\n$\\left\\lvert g\\right\\rangle = \\left\\lvert g_1\\right\\rangle$.\nHowever, quantum mechanics forbids a direct transition between these two\nstable states. To get from one state to the other, the electron\nwould have to change its rotation without giving out any energy, which\nis impossible! But we can take a detour: we use circularly polarized\nlaser light of a particular wavelength (397nm for Calcium-40) to excite\n$\\left\\lvert g_2\\right\\rangle$ into a short-lived excited state\n$\\left\\lvert \\textrm{aux}\\right\\rangle$. This light does not\nstimulate any other transitions in the ion so that an electron in the\nground state $\\left\\lvert g_1\\right\\rangle$ will remain there.\nQuantum mechanics tells us that, in a matter of nanoseconds, the excited electron\ndecays to our desired ground state $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$\nwith probability 1/3, but returns to\n$\\left\\lvert g_2 \\right\\rangle$ otherwise. For this reason, we\nneed to repeat the procedure many times, gradually \"pumping\" the\nelectrons in all (or the vast majority of) our ions to the ground state.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/pumping.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Optical pumping to prepare the ground state\n\nWhat about the other basis qubit state? It will be a long-lived excited\nstate, denoted by $\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle$. For the\nCalcium-40 ion, this state is a *metastable state:* a state that\nhas a sufficiently long lifetime since quantum mechanics restricts, but\ndoes not entirely forbid, transitions to a lower energy level. For\nexample, the metastable state of Calcium-40 has a half-life of about 1\nsecond. While apparently short, most quantum operations can be performed\non a timescale of micro to milliseconds. The energy difference between the ground and\nexcited state corresponds to a laser frequency of 729nm, achievable with\nan infrared laser. Therefore, we call this an **optical qubit**. An\nalternative is to use an ion, such as Calcium-43, that has a *hyperfine\nstructure*, which means that the ground and excited states are separated by a very small\nenergy gap. In this case, the higher energy state has a virtually\ninfinite lifespan, since it is only slightly different\nfrom the stable ground state. We can use a procedure similar to optical pumping to\ntransition between these two states, so while coherence times are longer\nfor these **hyperfine qubits**, gate implementation is more complicated\nand needs a lot of precision.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/hyperfine.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Optical vs. hyperfine qubits\n\nWe have now learned how trapped ions make for very stable qubits that\nallow us to implement many quantum operations without decohering too\nsoon. We have also learned how to prepare these qubits in a stable\nground state. Does this mean that we have already satisfied DiVincezo's\nfirst, second, and third criteria? We have definitely fulfilled the\nsecond one since optical pumping is a very robust method. However, we\nhave mainly been focusing on a single qubit and, since we have not\ndiscussed scalability yet, we have not fully satisfied the first\ncriterion. Introducing more ions will pose additional challenges to\nmeeting the third criterion. For now, let us focus on how to satisfy\ncriteria 4 and 5, and we will come back to these issues once we discuss\nwhat happens when we deal with multiple ions.\n\nNon-demolition measurements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLet us now discuss the last step in a quantum computation: measuring the\nqubits. Since it takes quite a bit of work to trap an ion, it would be\nideal if we could measure the state of our qubits without it escaping\nfrom the trap. We definitely do not want to trap ions again after performing\none measurement. Moreover, we want measurements that can be repeated\non the same ions and yield consistent results. These are called **non-demolition\nmeasurements**, and they are easy enough to carry out for trapped ions.\n\nThe measurement method uses a similar principle to that of optical\npumping. Once again, and continuing with the Calcium-40 example, we make\nuse of the auxiliary state. This time, we shine a laser light wavelength\nof 397 nm that drives the transition from\n$\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$ to the auxiliary state\n$\\left\\lvert \\textrm{aux} \\right\\rangle$. The transition is\nshort-lived; it will quickly go back to $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$,\nemitting a photon of the same wavelength. The state\n$\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle$ is not affected. Therefore,\nwe will measure $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$ if\nwe see the ion glowing: it continuously emits light at a wavelength of\n397 nm. Conversely, if the ion is dark, we will have measured the result\ncorresponding to state $\\left\\lvert e\\right\\rangle$. To see the\nphotons emitted by the ions, we need to collect the photons using a lens\nand a photomultiplier, a device that transforms weak light signals into\nelectric currents.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/measurement.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Non-demolition measurement of ion states\n\nHave we fully satisfied the fifth criterion? Via a careful experimental\narrangement, we can detect the emission of photons of each atom\nindividually, so we are on the right track. But in reality, there is\nalso some uncertainty in the measurement. In many quantum computing\nalgorithms, we only measure the state of a pre-chosen set of ions called\nthe **ancilla**. If these ions emit light, they can accidentally excite\nother ions on the chain, causing decoherence. A way to avoid this source\nof uncertainty is to use two species of ions: one for the ancilla and\none for the qubits that are not measured, or **logical qubits**.\nIn this case, the ions emitted by the ancilla ions would not excite the\nlogical qubits. However, using two different species of ions causes\nextra trouble when we want to implement arbitrary qubit operations [#Hughes2020]_.\n\nRabi oscillations to manipulate single qubits\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHow do we make single-qubit quantum gates? Namely, is there a way to put the electron in a\nsuperposition of the ground and excited states? Since we aim to change\nthe energy state of an electron, we have no choice but to continue using\nlasers to shoot photons at it, tuning the frequency to the\nenergy gap. To understand how we would achieve a superposition by\ninteracting with the ion using light, let us look at a mathematical\noperator called the *Hamiltonian*. In physics, the Hamiltonian describes\nthe motion and external forces around an object we want to study. One of\nthe main difficulties encountered in quantum mechanics is determining\nthe correct Hamiltonian for a system. In our case, this work has already\nbeen done by quantum optics experts. After many simplifications\ninvolving some approximations, we find that the Hamiltonian that\ndescribes an electron in an ion resonant to the laser light is given by\nthe operator\n\n\\begin{align}\\hat{H}=\\frac{\\hbar\\Omega}{2}\\left(S_+ e^{i\\varphi}+S_{-}e^{-i\\varphi}\\right).\\end{align}\n\nHere, $\\Omega$ is the **Rabi frequency**. It is defined by\n$\\Omega=\\mu_m B/2\\hbar$, where $B$ is the applied magnetic\nfield due to the laser, and $\\mu_m$ is the magnetic moment of the\nion. The phase $\\varphi$ measures the initial displacement of the\nlight wave at the atom's position. The matrices $S_+$ and\n$S_-$ are \n\n\\begin{align}S_+=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right), \\qquad S_-=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right).\\end{align}\n\nHamiltonians in physics are helpful because they tell us how systems\nchange with time in the presence of external interactions. In quantum\nmechanics, Hamiltonians are represented by matrices, and the evolution of a system is\ncalculated using Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. When the Hamiltonian does not\ndepend on time, a qubit starting in state \n$\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$ will evolve into the following\ntime-dependent state:\n\n\\begin{align}\\left\\lvert \\psi(t)\\right\\rangle = \\exp(-i \\hat{H} t/\\hbar)\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\exp$ denotes the matrix exponential and $t$ is\nthe duration of the interaction, which is controlled using *pulses*, i.e., short\nbursts of light. We do not need to\nelaborate on how matrix exponentials are calculated, since we can\nimplement them using the scipy library in Python. Let us see how our\nbasis states $\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$ and\n$\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle$ ($\\left\\lvert 0 \\right\\rangle$ and\n$\\left\\lvert 1 \\right\\rangle$ in PennyLane) evolve under the action of this\nHamiltonian. First, we write a function that returns the matrix exponential\n$\\exp(-i \\hat{H} t/\\hbar)$ as a function of $\\varphi$ and the\nduration $t$ of the pulse, with $\\Omega$ set to 100 kHz.\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import expm\n\nOmega = 100\nS_plus = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 0]])\nS_minus = np.array([[0, 1], [0, 0]])\n\n\ndef evolution(phi, t):\n    Ham = Omega / 2 * (S_plus * np.exp(1j * phi) + S_minus * np.exp(-1j * phi))\n    return expm(-1j * Ham * t)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["With this operator implemented, we can determine the sequences of pulses that\nproduce common gates.

Since we can generate\narbitrary X and Y rotations using $\\varphi=0$ and\n$\\varphi=\\pi/2$, Rabi oscillations allow us to build a\nuniversal set of single-qubit gates.\n\nAchieving the required superpositions of quantum states requires precise\ncontrol of the timing and phase of the pulse. This feat is not easy, but\nit is not the most challenging step towards creating a trapped-ion\nquantum computer. For typical Rabi frequencies of $\\Omega=100$\nkHz, the single-qubit gates can be implemented in a few milliseconds\nwith high accuracy. Thus, we can implement quantum algorithms involving\nmany gates even for the seemingly short lifespans of optical qubits. As\na consequence, we have now satisfied the single-qubit gate requirement of criterion 4. \nThe rest of this criterion is not theoretically difficult to implement. \nHowever, it can be experimentally challenging.\n\nThe ion chain as a harmonic oscillator\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo fully address the fourth criterion, we need to create\ngates on two qubits. How can we\nachieve this? It turns out that placing ions in a\nchain is ideal for multiple-qubit gate implementations. When cooled\ndown, the entire ion chain acts as a **quantum harmonic oscillator**,\nmeaning that it can vibrate with energies that are multiples of Planck's\nconstant $\\hbar$ times a fundamental frequency\n$\\omega$:\n\n\\begin{align}E=n\\hbar\\omega.\\end{align}\n\nWhen the chain is oscillating with energy $E=n\\hbar\\omega$, we\ndenote the harmonic oscillator state, also known as **phonon state** or\n**motional state**, by $\\left\\lvert n\\right\\rangle$. The harmonic\noscillator can absorb and emit energy in multiples of\n$\\hbar\\omega$, in packets of energy known as **phonons**.\nWhen we shine laser light on a particular atom of\nthe ion chain, the entire chain could absorb the energy of the photons\nand start oscillating. However, we have seen that this does not happen\nwhen the atoms are cooled down and the light frequency matches the\nenergy gap. Instead, the atom changes energy level, and we can\nmanipulate a single qubit. But what happens when the frequency is away\nfrom this value? In most cases, it does nothing, but it will excite both\nthe atom and the harmonic oscillator in some special circumstances. We\ncan use the harmonic oscillator states as auxiliary states that will\nallow us to build two-qubit gates.\n\nLet us introduce some notation that will help us understand exactly how\nthe two-qubit gates are implemented. When an ion is in the ground state\n$\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle$ and the chain is in the state\n$\\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle$, we will write the state as\n$\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle$, and\nsimilarly when the ion is in the excited state\n$\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle$. If we are studying two ions at the\nsame time, then we will write the states in the form\n$\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle\\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle$,\nwhere the last $\\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle$ always represents the\nstate of the oscillating ion chain. Suppose that the ion's energy gap\nvalue is $\\Delta$, and we shine light of frequency\n$\\omega_b=\\omega+\\Delta$ on a particular ion. If it is in the\nground state, it will absorb an energy $\\Delta$, and the ion chain\nwill absorb the rest. Therefore, this light frequency induces the\nfollowing **blue sideband** transition:\n\n\\begin{align}\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle \\rightarrow \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert n+1\\right\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nBy using the frequency $\\omega_r=\\Delta-\\omega$, we can instead\nexcite the ion and de-excite the ion chain, also known as a\n**red sideband** transition:\n\n\\begin{align}\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle \\rightarrow \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert n-1\\right\\rangle.\\end{align}\n\nCrucially, this frequency will do nothing if the ion chain is in the\nstate of zero energy.\nIf the light frequency is exactly $\\Delta$,\nthe ion chain does not absorb any phonons, but the ion does become\nexcited. We will call this a **carrier** transition.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/sidebands.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Effects of the sideband and carrier frequencies on an ion chain\n\nSince the oscillations of the ion chain are quantum states, we may\nwonder whether we can also create superpositions of motional states. For\nboth the red and blue sideband frequencies, the Hamiltonian turns out to\nbe similar to the one we saw above, but with a different Rabi frequency\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}$. Following the same prescription as with single\nions, we can tune the duration and phase of the pulses to form\nsuperpositions of phonon states. For example, for a blue sideband pulse\nof duration $t=\\pi/2\\tilde{\\Omega}$ and phase\n$\\varphi=\\pi/2$, a system of two ions in both the motional and\nelectronic ground state evolves as\n\n\\begin{align}\\left\\lvert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert n\\right\\rangle \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left\\lvert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert n\\right\\rangle + \\left\\lvert e\\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert n+1\\right\\rangle\\right)\\end{align}\n\nwhen the pulse is incident on the first ion. Similarly, other choices of\nduration and phase allow for arbitrary superpositions between phonon\nstates. This freedom to act on the motional states gives us the\nnecessary tools to implement two-qubit gates. We will see two examples\nand use one of them to build a CNOT gate which, as is well-known, allows\nfor universal computations when combined with single-qubit gates.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>The results above are relatively simple to understand, but they\n    are not exact. In particular, to guarantee that the sideband frequencies\n    will have the effects we described on the ion chain, the separation between\n    ions must be large enough, in a range known as the Lamb-Dicke regime. If we do\n    not operate under this condition, stronger interactions will come into\n    play, and we will not be able to act on individual ions with the laser\n    beams.</p></div>\n\nEntangling ions with multi-qubit gates\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. container:: alert alert-block alert-info\n\n   **Maximally entangled states:** When all outcomes have the same\n   probability in an entangled state, such as in the two-ion state\n\n   .. math::\n\n      \\left\\lvert \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle +\n      \\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle\\right),\n\n   we say that it is **maximally entangled**. To be able to do arbitrary\n   computations and for quantum advantage to be possible, we need two-qubit gates\n   that, combined with single qubit gates, produce maximally entangled states.\n   The CNOT gate is an example of this, and we will learn about others below.\n\n\nThe **Cirac-Zoller** gate [#CiracZoller]_ can completely entangle ions. It is also the\nsimplest way to illustrate how we can use the states of the harmonic\noscillator as an aid to create two-qubit gates. For a chain\nwith zero motional energy, we saw above that\napplying a blue sideband pulse of duration $t=\\pi/2\\tilde{\\Omega}$ and phase\n$\\varphi=\\pi/2$ to the first ion gives us the state\n\n\\begin{align}\\left\\lvert \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left\\lvert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert 0\\right\\rangle + \\left\\lvert e\\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert g\\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert 1\\right\\rangle\\right).\\end{align}\n\nWe can then use a similar idea to keep creating superpositions until we\nend up in a maximally entangled state. The steps to implement the\nCirac-Zoller gate are shown on the diagram:\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/CZgate.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 85%\n\n   ..\n\n   Implementation of the Cirac-Zoller gate using phonon states\n\nWe see that the consecutive application of a blue sideband, a carrier\nfrequency, and a red sideband, with different durations, gives us a\nmaximally entangled state. It is important to note that, in the last\nstep, the part of the superposition that has no chain motion is\nunaffected by the red sideband. This property allows the creation of\nentanglement in electronic states by using the phonon states.\n\nHowever, the implementation of the Cirac-Zoller gate in real life is\nplagued by problems. First, the ion chain needs to be completely cooled\ndown to the ground motional state, which can never be achieved. Second,\nthe gate is too slow. Surely, if we use hyperfine qubits, we can take as\nlong as we want to implement the gates. The problem comes from the\nharmonic oscillator states. Since ion chains are large and less isolated\nfrom the environment, phonon states are rather short-lived due to\ndecoherence.\n\nFor actual applications, we use a more ingenious gate, known as the\n**M\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen** gate [#Molmer1999]_. It has the advantage that the ions do not\nneed to be perfectly cooled to the motional ground state for it to work.\nIt relies on simultaneously shining two lasers at different frequencies\n$\\omega_{\\pm}$ on the two target ions, which are slightly detuned\nfrom the atomic energy gap $\\Delta$:\n\n\\begin{align}\\omega_{\\pm}=\\Delta \\pm \\delta\\end{align}\n\nThe net effect of this interaction with laser light is to excite\n$\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle \\rightarrow \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle\\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle$,\nand it can do so through any of the four paths shown below:\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/molmer_sorensen.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   M\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen gate implemented with two simultaneous laser pulses\n\nUsing a quantum mechanical technique known as perturbation theory, we\ncan deduce that there is also a Rabi frequency $\\Omega_{MS}$\nassociated with this evolution. Therefore, adjusting the time and the\nphase of the lasers can lead to a superposition of\n$\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle$\nand\n$\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle\\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle$.\nFor example, we can obtain the state\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle\\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle +\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle\\left\\lvert n \\right\\rangle\\right)$\nwhich, in the two-ion subsystem, corresponds to the maximally entangled state\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert g \\right\\rangle +\\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle \\left\\lvert e \\right\\rangle\\right)$.\nUsing Schr\u00f6dinger's equation allows us to derive how the qubits evolve\nwhen we apply the M\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen protocol for a time $t$. The\nHamiltonian is more involved, so we will not do this. We simply state\nthe result (for zero phase) and implement it via a Python function\n\n\\begin{align}U_{MS}(t) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cccc}\n                \\cos(\\frac{\\Omega_{MS}t}{2}) & 0 & 0 & -i\\sin(\\frac{\\Omega_{MS} t}{2})\\\\\n                0 & \\cos(\\frac{\\Omega_{MS} t}{2}) & -i\\sin(\\frac{\\Omega_{MS} t}{2}) & 0 \\\\\n                0 & -i\\sin(\\frac{\\Omega_{MS} t}{2}) & \\cos(\\frac{\\Omega_{MS} t}{2}) & 0 \\\\\n                 -i\\sin(\\frac{\\Omega_{MS} t}{2}) & 0 & 0 & \\cos(\\frac{\\Omega_{MS} t}{2})\n                 \\end{array}\n                 \\right)\\end{align}\n\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["Omega = 100\n\n\ndef Molmer_Sorensen(t):\n    ms = np.array(\n        [\n            [np.cos(Omega * t / 2), 0, 0, -1j * np.sin(Omega * t / 2)],\n            [0, np.cos(Omega * t / 2), -1j * np.sin(Omega * t / 2), 0],\n            [0, -1j * np.sin(Omega * t / 2), np.cos(Omega * t / 2), 0],\n            [-1j * np.sin(Omega * t / 2), 0, 0, np.cos(Omega * t / 2)],\n        ]\n    )\n    return ms"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Since the CNOT gate is commonly used in quantum algorithms, let us\ndetermine how to obtain it from the M\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen gate.\nIt is possible to do so by using a combination of\nsingle-qubit rotations and the M\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen gate applied for a period of\n$t=\\pi/2\\Omega_{MS}$.

This property also makes this gate more robust to the\ndecoherence of the chain.\n\nThe problem with too many ions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe have learned that the trapped ion paradigm allows us to prepare and\nmeasure individual qubits, and that we can implement single and\nmulti-qubit gates with high accuracy. What's not to like? As in every\nphysical realization of quantum computers, trapped ions come with\nadvantages and disadvantages. The main problem shared by all physical\nimplementations of quantum computers is scalability. The root of the\nproblem and the technological challenges involved depend on our\nparticular framework.\n\nTo understand why scalability is a problem for trapped ions, let us\nconsider a long ion chain. As discussed in the previous section, to\nimplement multi-qubit gates, we need to lean on the harmonic oscillator\nstates of the ion chains. These turn out to be a blessing and a curse\nsimultaneously. Quantum computing with trapped ions would not be\npossible without motional states. However, if we put more ions in the\nchain, the values of the frequencies needed to excite it become too\nclose together. As a consequence, unless we are extremely careful with\nour laser frequencies, we may end up in the wrong quantum state. We do\nnot have infinite precision, so when the number of ions becomes close to\n100, our current gate technology becomes practically unusable.\n\nIs there a way to make the frequency values more spread out? One way is\nto reduce the Rabi frequency of the M\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen gate, which we\ncontrol by changing the strength of the laser light. Disappointingly,\nnot only does this strategy make it harder to control the ion, but it\nalso increases the time needed to apply the M\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen gate. As\nalready mentioned in the previous section, time is of the essence when\napplying multi-qubit gates since the motional states of the chain are\nextremely sensitive to decoherence. We cannot afford to have even slower\ngates.\n\nWhich of the DiVincenzo criteria do trapped ions quantum computers still\nfail to meet? Criterion 1 is only met partially: we do have robust\nqubits, but there seems to be a hard technological limit for\nscalability. Criterion 3 also becomes an issue when the ion chain is too\nlong since coherence times for motional states become shorter. The\ntwo-qubit requirement of criterion 4 is related to this decoherence problem since\nmulti-qubit gates can take too long to implement accurately in a long\nion chain. Criterion 2, as already discussed, does not present too much\nof a problem thanks to optical pumping technology. However, problems remain for criterion 5.\nAs we already saw, we can use two different\nspecies of ions to obtain good measurements. But, in general, it is\nchallenging to implement consecutive good-quality two-qubit gates\nbetween different ion species; strategies like the M\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen\ngate will not work and need modification.\n\nThe state of the art\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOf course, no matter how insurmountable these challenges seem to be,\nphysicists will not give up. Many ingenious ways to address these\ntechnical complications have already been proposed. Not surprisingly, it\nis one of the hottest research topics in quantum computing, and papers\nwith newer technologies have probably been published since this tutorial\nwas written.\n\nThe main issue discussed above is that a long ion chain is noisy and\nmakes qubits challenging to manipulate. In 2002, Kielpinski and\ncollaborators [#QCCD2002]_ came up with an intelligent solution: if size is a\nproblem, let us make the chain shorter! Of course, we would still like\nto be able to manipulate thousands of qubits. To achieve this, we could\nbuild a segmented trap, also known as a **QCCD** (Quantum Charge-Coupled\nDevice) **architecture**. The idea is to make our traps mobile. We could\nmove ions from one place to another whenever we need to apply a\nmulti-qubit gate and move them far away when we need to manipulate them\nindividually. Thus, the chain that we interact with when we need to\nentangle qubits is not long. This method makes the motional states less\nprone to decoherence. The phonon frequencies are also sufficiently\nspread apart so that the gates can be implemented.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/trapped_ions/qccd.png\n   :align: center\n   :width: 60%\n\n   ..\n\n   Example of a proposed QCCD architecture, as in [#Amini2010]_\n\nQCCD architectures sound like a straightforward solution, but seeing as\nwe do not have large quantum computers yet, there must be some nuances.\nIn practice, moving ions around a trap is not easy at all. The\ncontaining potential must be changed in a highly accurate manner to\ntransport the ions without losing them. Such technology has not been\nperfected yet. While it has been possible to manipulate ions and make\nthem interact, the traps we need for a good quantum computer are\nsomewhat involved. We want multiple segments in the trap that allow for\narbitrary ions to be brought together to run quantum algorithms without\nany limitations. In April 2021, Honeywell reported building a\nmulti-segment QCCD architecture with six qubits and two interaction\nzones [#Pino2021]_. However, it is unclear how this proposed technology would scale\nto higher orders of magnitude.\n\nAnother path towards a solution would be to simply accept the short\ncoherence times of the ion chains, and try to make the two-qubit gates\nfaster. Such an approach is being followed by the startup IonQ. In\nJanuary 2021, they showed that it is possible to speed up the\nM\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen gate by one order of magnitude by changing the shape\nof the laser pulse [#Blumel2021]_. Such a speedup might not be enough as the ion chain\ngrows. However, a combination of approaches involving QCCDs and\nfaster gates may yield the solution to the scalability problem in the\nfuture.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>There is another proposed solution to apply two-qubit gates efficiently, which\n   involves connecting the ions with photons. Using polarization state\n   measurements, we can also entangle electronic states [#Monroe2014]_. This technology\n   is still in the early stages of development.</p></div>\n\nImplementing multi-qubit gates is not the only problem for\ntrapped-ion quantum computers. There is still much to do to improve the\nprecision of measurements, for example. Most of the photons emitted by\nions during a measurement are lost, so it would be good to find ways to\ndirect more of them to the detector. One can do this using a waveguide architecture inside\nthe trap. Similarly, as the number of ions grows, the number of laser\nbeams we need does as well [#Niffenegger2020]_. Again, waveguides can also be used to\ndirect the photons to target ions. Combined with a better QCCD\narchitecture, this optical integration would well-equip us to run\nquantum computing algorithms with trapped ions.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIon trapping is currently one of the most widespread physical implementations\nof quantum computers, both in academia and in industry. Their popularity comes\nas no surprise, since the physical principles that make the paradigm work are\nsimple enough, and the necessary technology is already well-developed.\nGranted, there are challenging technical difficulties to scale these quantum\ncomputers further. However, viable solutions have been proposed, and many\ninstitutions around the world are working non-stop to make them a reality.\nMoreover, what could be considered simple prototypes of such technologies have\nalready proven extremely powerful. The big unknown is whether such devices can scale as much as we\nwould like them to. It would be unwise to give up only because the challenge is\nimposing. After all, personal computers were the fruit of hard work and\ninventiveness, and very few people were able to predict that they would scale\nas much as they have. Now you possess a high-level knowledge of how trapped\nion computers work! Make sure to read any new papers that come out\nto keep updated on new developments. Will the trapped ion framework\nemerge victorious in this race to obtain a useful quantum computer? Only time will tell!\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n.. [#DiVincenzo2000]\n\n    D. DiVincenzo.
