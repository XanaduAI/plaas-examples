[#Huggins]_. Tensor-network quantum circuits emulate the shape and connectivity of tensor networks such as matrix product states \nand tree tensor networks.\n\nWe begin with a short introduction to tensor networks and explain their relationship to quantum circuits. Next, we \nillustrate how PennyLane's templates make it easy to design, customize, and simulate these circuits. Finally, we\nshow how to use the circuits to learn to classify the bars and stripes data set. This is a toy problem where the template\nlearns to recognize whether an image exhibits horizontal stripes or vertical bars.\n\nTensors and Tensor Networks\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nTensors are multi-dimensional arrays of numbers. \nIntuitively, they can be interpreted as a\ngeneralization of scalars, vectors, and matrices. \nTensors can be described by their rank, indices, and the dimension of the indices.\nThe rank is the number of indices in a tensor --- a scalar has \nrank zero, a vector has rank one, and a matrix has rank two.\nThe dimension of an index is the number of values that index can take.\nFor example, a vector with three elements has one index that can take three\nvalues. This is vector is therefore a rank one tensor and its index has dimension\nthree.\n\nTo define tensor networks, it is important to first understand tensor contraction.\nTwo or more tensors can be contracted by summing over repeated indices.\nIn diagrammatic notation, the repeated indices appear as lines connecting tensors, as in the figure below. \nWe see two tensors of rank two connected by one repeated index, $k$. The dimension of the\nrepeated index is called the bond dimension.\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/simple_tn_color.PNG)\n\n    :align: center\n    :width: 50 %\n\nThe contraction of the tensors above is equivalent to the standard \nmatrix multiplication formula and can be expressed as\n\n\\begin{align}C_{ij} = \\sum_{k}A_{ik}B_{kj},\\end{align}\n\nwhere $C_{ij}$ denotes the entry for the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of the product $C=AB$. \n\nA tensor network is a collection of tensors where a subset of \nall indices are contracted. As mentioned above, we can use diagrammatic notation\nto specify which indices and tensors will be contracted together by connecting\nindividual tensors with lines.\nTensor networks can represent complicated operations involving\nseveral tensors with many indices contracted in sophisticated patterns.\n\nTwo well-known tensor network architectures are matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor networks (TTN). \nThese follow specific patterns of connections between tensors and can be extended to have\nmany or few indices. Examples of these architectures with only a few tensors \ncan be seen in the figure below. An MPS is shown on the left and a TTN on the right.\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/MPS_TTN_Color.PNG)\n\n    :align: center\n    :width: 50 %\n\nThese tensor networks are commonly used to efficiently represent certain many-body quantum\nstates [#orus]_. Every quantum circuit can be represented as a tensor network, with the bond\ndimension dependent on the width and connectivity of the circuit. Moreover, one can design\nquantum circuits that have the same connectivity as well-known tensor networks like MPS and TTN.\nWe call these **tensor-network quantum circuits**.\nNote that the connectivity of a tensor network is related to how entanglement is distributed and\nhow correlations spread in the resulting tensor-network quantum circuit. We therefore design\ncircuits based on the tensor networks that best capture the information we want to extract.\n\nIn tensor-network quantum circuits, the tensor network architecture acts as a\nguideline for the shape of the quantum circuit.\nMore specifically, the tensors in the tensor networks above are replaced with\nunitary operations to obtain quantum circuits, as illustrated in the figure below.\n\n![](https://pennylane.ai/qml/_images/MPS_TTN_Circuit_Color.PNG)\n\n    :align: center\n    :width: 70 %\n\n.. |vspace| raw:: latex\n\n   \\vspace{15mm}\n\n|vspace|\n\nSince the unitary operations $U_1$ to $U_3$ are in principle completely general,\nit is not always clear how to implement them with a specific gate set. \nInstead, we can replace the unitary operations with variational quantum circuits\ndetermined by a specific template of choice.\nThe PennyLane tensor network templates allow us to do precisely this: implement tensor-network quantum\ncircuits with user-defined circuit ansatze as the unitary operations. In this sense, just as a template\nis a strategy for arranging parametrized gates, tensor-network quantum circuits\nare strategies for structuring circuit templates. They can therefore be interpreted as templates of templates,\ni.e., as meta-templates.\n\n\n\nPennyLane Implementation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWe now demonstrate how to use PennyLane to build and simulate tensor-network quantum circuits.\n\nThe first step is to define the circuit that will be broadcast into the tensor network shape.\nWe call this a block.
