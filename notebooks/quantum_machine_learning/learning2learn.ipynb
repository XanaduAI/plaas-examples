After that, we deep dive into the\ncode to build a fully functioning model, ready to be further developed\nor customized for your own needs. Without further ado, let\u2019s begin!\n\n\nProblem: Optimization of Variational Quantum Algorithms\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecently, a big effort by the quantum computing community has been\ndevoted to the study of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs)\nwhich leverage quantum circuits with fixed shape and tunable\nparameters. The idea is similar to\nclassical neural networks, where the weights of the network are\noptimized during training. Similarly, once the shape of the variational quantum\ncircuit is chosen \u2014 something that is very difficult and sensitive to\nthe particular task at hand \u2014 its tunable parameters are optimized\niteratively by minimizing a cost (or loss) function, which measures how\ngood the quantum algorithm is performing (see [#vqas]_ for a\nthorough overview on VQAs).\n\nA major challenge for VQAs relates to the optimization of tunable\nparameters, which was shown to be a very hard task [#barren]_, [#vqas]_ .\nParameter initialization plays a key role in this scenario,\nsince initializing the parameters in the proximity of an optimal\nsolution leads to faster convergence and better results. Thus, a good initialization\nstrategy is crucial to promote the convergence of local optimizers to\nlocal extrema and to select reasonably good local minima. By local\noptimizer, we mean a procedure that moves from one solution to another\nby small (local) changes in parameter space. These are opposed to global\nsearch methods, which take into account large sections of\nparameter space to propose a new solution.\n\nOne such strategy could come from the classical machine learning\nliterature.\n\nSolution: Classical Recurrent Neural Networks\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy building on results from the *meta-learning* literature in machine learning,\nauthors in [#l2l]_ propose to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nas a black-box controller to optimize the parameters of\nvariational quantum algorithms, as shown in the figure below. The cost\nfunction used is the expectation value $\\langle H \\rangle_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\langle \\psi_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} | H | \\psi_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\rangle$\nof a Hamiltonian $H$ with respect to the parametrized state\n$|\\psi_\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\rangle$ evolved by applying the variational quantum circuit to the zero state $|00\\cdots0\\rangle$.\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/learning2learn/HybridLSTM.png\n    :align: center\n    :width: 100%\n\nGiven parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t-1}$ of the variational quantum circuit,\nthe cost function $y_{t-1}$, and the hidden state of the\nclassical network $\\boldsymbol{h}_{t-1}$ at the previous time step, the\nrecurrent neural network proposes a new\nguess for the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t$, which are\nthen fed into the quantum computer to evaluate the\ncost function $y_t$. By repeating this cycle a few times, and\nby training the weights of the recurrent neural network to minimize\nthe loss function $y_t$, a good initialization heuristic is\nfound for the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ of the variational\nquantum circuit.\n\nAt a given iteration, the RNN receives as input the previous cost\nfunction $y_t$ evaluated on the quantum computer, where\n$y_t$ is the estimate of $\\langle H\\rangle_{t}$, as well as\nthe parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t$ for which the variational\ncircuit was evaluated. The RNN at this time step also receives\ninformation stored in its internal hidden state from the previous time\nstep $\\boldsymbol{h}_t$. The RNN itself has trainable parameters $\\phi$,\nand hence it applies the parametrized mapping:\n\n\\begin{align}\\boldsymbol{h}_{t+1}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t+1} = \\text{RNN}_{\\phi}(\\boldsymbol{h}_{t}, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}, y_{t}),\\end{align}\n\nwhich generates a new suggestion for the variational parameters as well\nas a new internal state.\nUpon training the weights $\\phi$, the RNN\neventually learns a good heuristic to suggest optimal parameters for the\nquantum circuit.\n\nThus, by training on a dataset of graphs, the RNN can subsequently be used to\nprovide suggestions for starting points on new graphs! We are not directly optimizing the variational parameters of\nthe quantum circuit, but instead, we let the RNN figure out how to do that.\nIn this sense, we are learning (training the RNN) how to learn (how to optimize a variational quantum circuit).\n\n\n**VQAs in focus: QAOA for MaxCut**\n\nThere are multiple VQAs for which this hybrid training routine could\nbe used, some of them directly analyzed in [#l2l]_. In the\nfollowing, we focus on one such example, the\nQuantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for solving\nthe MaxCut problem [#maxcutwiki]_. Thus, referring to the picture above,\nthe shape of the variational circuit is the one dictated by the QAOA\nansatz, and such a quantum circuit is used to evaluate the cost\nHamiltonian $H$ of the MaxCut problem.\nCheck out this great tutorial on\nhow to use QAOA for solving graph problems: https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qaoa_intro.html\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Running the tutorial (excluding the Appendix) requires approx. ~13m.</p></div>\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["**Importing the required packages**\n\n\nDuring this tutorial, we will use\n**PennyLane** for executing quantum circuits and for integrating\nseamlessly with **TensorFlow**, which will be used for creating the RNN.\n\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Quantum Machine Learning\nimport pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import qaoa\n\n# Classical Machine Learning\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Generation of graphs\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Standard Python libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport random\n\n# Fix the seed for reproducibility, which affects all random functions in this demo\nrandom.seed(42)\nnp.random.seed(42)\ntf.random.set_seed(42)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Generation of training data: graphs\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe first step is to gather or\ncreate a good dataset that will be used to train the model\nand test its performance.

In\nfact, until now our analysis focused only on graphs with the same number\nof nodes for ease of explanation, and there is no actual restriction in\nthis respect. The same machinery works fine for any graph, since the\nnumber of QAOA parameters are only dependent on the number of layers in\nthe ansatz, and not on the number of qubits (equal to the number of\nnodes in the graph) in the quantum circuit.\n\nThus, we might want to challenge our model to learn a good\ninitialization heuristic for a non-specific graph, with an arbitrary\nnumber of nodes.
