Posted: 3 Feb 2021. Last updated: 3 Feb 2021.*\n\nOver the last few years, quantum machine learning research has provided a lot of insights on\nhow we can understand and train quantum circuits as machine learning models.\nWhile many connections to neural networks have been made, it becomes increasingly clear that\ntheir mathematical foundation is intimately related to so-called *kernel methods*, the most famous\nof which is the `support vector machine (SVM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine>`__\n(see for example `Schuld and Killoran (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07128>`__,\n`Havlicek et al. (2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11326>`__,\n`Liu et al. (2020) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02174>`__,\n`Huang et al. (2020) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01938>`__,\nand, for a systematic summary which we will follow here,\n`Schuld (2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11020>`__).\n\nThe link between quantum models and kernel methods has important practical implications:\nwe can replace the common `variational approach <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/variational_circuit.html>`__\nto quantum machine learning with a classical kernel method where the kernel\u2014a small building block\nof the overall algorithm\u2014is computed by a quantum device. In many situations there are\nguarantees that we get better or at least equally good results.\n\nThis demonstration explores how kernel-based training compares with\n`variational training <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier.html>`__ in terms of the number of quantum\ncircuits that have to be evaluated. For this we train a quantum machine\nlearning model with a kernel-based approach using a combination of PennyLane\nand the `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`__ machine\nlearning library. We compare this strategy with a variational\nquantum circuit trained via stochastic gradient descent using\n`PyTorch <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/interfaces/torch.html>`__.\n\nWe will see that in a typical small-scale example, kernel-based training requires only a fraction of the number of\nquantum circuit evaluations used by variational circuit training, while each\nevaluation runs a much shorter circuit.\nIn general, the relative efficiency of kernel-based methods compared to variational circuits\ndepends on the number of parameters used in the variational model.\n\n.. figure::  ../demonstrations/kernel_based_training/scaling.png\n       :align: center\n       :scale: 100%\n       :alt: Scaling of kernel-based vs. variational learning\n\nIf the number of variational parameters remains small, e.g., there is a square-root-like scaling with the number\nof data samples (green line), variational circuits are almost as efficient as neural networks (blue line),\nand require much fewer circuit evaluations\nthan the quadratic scaling of kernel methods (red line).\nHowever, with current hardware-compatible training strategies,\nkernel methods scale much better than variational circuits that require a number of parameters of the\norder of the training set size (orange line).\n\nIn conclusion, **for quantum machine learning applications with many parameters, kernel-based training can be a great\nalternative to the variational approach to quantum machine learning**.\n\nAfter working through this demo, you will:\n\n* be able to use a support vector machine with a quantum kernel computed with PennyLane, and\n\n* be able to compare the scaling of quantum circuit evaluations required in kernel-based versus\n  variational training.\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Background\n----------\n\nLet us consider a *quantum model* of the form\n\n\\begin{align}f(x) = \\langle \\phi(x) | \\mathcal{M} | \\phi(x)\\rangle,\\end{align}\n\nwhere $| \\phi(x)\\rangle$ is prepared\nby a fixed `embedding\ncircuit <https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary/quantum_embedding.html>`__ that\nencodes data inputs $x$,\nand $\\mathcal{M}$ is an arbitrary observable. This model includes variational\nquantum machine learning models, since the observable can\neffectively be implemented by a simple measurement that is preceded by a\nvariational circuit:\n\n\n.. figure:: ../demonstrations/kernel_based_training/quantum_model.png\n      :align: center\n      :scale: 20%\n      :alt: quantum-model\n\n|\n\nFor example, applying a circuit $G(\\theta)$ and then\nmeasuring the Pauli-Z observable $\\sigma^0_z$ of the first qubit\nimplements the trainable measurement\n$\\mathcal{M}(\\theta) = G^{\\dagger}(\\theta) \\sigma^0_z G(\\theta)$.\n\nThe main practical consequence of approaching quantum machine learning with a\nkernel approach is that instead of training $f$ variationally,\nwe can often train an equivalent classical kernel method with a kernel executed on a\nquantum device. This *quantum kernel*\nis given by the mutual overlap of two data-encoding quantum states,\n\n\\begin{align}\\kappa(x, x') = | \\langle \\phi(x') | \\phi(x)\\rangle|^2.\\end{align}\n\nKernel-based training therefore bypasses the processing and measurement\nparts of common variational circuits, and only depends on the\ndata encoding.\n\nIf the loss function $L$ is the `hinge\nloss <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge_loss>`__, the kernel method\ncorresponds to a standard `support vector\nmachine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine>`__ (SVM)\nin the sense of a maximum-margin classifier. Other convex loss functions\nlead to more general variations of support vector machines.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>More precisely, we can replace variational with kernel-based\n   training if the optimisation\n   problem can be written as minimizing a cost of the form\n\n   .. math::  \\min_f  \\lambda\\;  \\mathrm{tr}\\{\\mathcal{M}^2\\} + \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^M L(f(x^m), y^m),\n\n   which is a regularized empirical risk with training data samples $(x^m, y^m)_{m=1\\dots M}$,\n   regularization strength $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and loss function $L$.\n\n   Theory predicts that kernel-based training will always find better or equally good\n   minima of this risk. However, to show this here we would have\n   to either regularize the variational training by the trace of the squared observable, or switch off\n   regularization in the classical SVM, which removes a lot of its strength. The kernel-based and the variational\n   training in this demonstration therefore optimize slightly different cost\n   functions, and it is out of our scope to establish whether one training method finds a better minimum than\n   the other.</p></div>\n\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["Kernel-based training\n---------------------\n\nFirst, we will turn to kernel-based training of quantum models.\nAs stated above, an example implementation is a standard support vector\nmachine with a kernel computed by a quantum circuit.\n\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["We begin by importing all sorts of useful methods:\n\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import numpy as np\nimport torch\nfrom torch.nn.functional import relu\n\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\nimport pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane.templates import AngleEmbedding, StronglyEntanglingLayers\nfrom pennylane.operation import Tensor\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(42)"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The second step is to define a data set.

But we do not know yet whether variational circuits really need that many parameters as well.\n   We will therefore use two cases for comparison:\n\n   2a) the number of parameters grows linearly with the training data, or ``n_params = M``,\n\n   2b) the number of parameters saturates at some point, which we model by setting ``n_params = sqrt(M)``.\n\nNote that compared to the example above with 75 training samples and 24 parameters, a) overestimates the number of evaluations, while b)\nunderestimates it.\n\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["This is how the three methods compare:\n\n\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {"collapsed": false}, "outputs": [], "source": ["variational_training1 = []\nvariational_training2 = []\nkernelbased_training = []\nnn_training = []\nx_axis = range(0, 2000, 100)\n\nfor M in x_axis:\n\n    var1 = circuit_evals_variational(\n        n_data=M, n_params=M, n_steps=M,  shift_terms=2, split=0.75, batch_size=1\n    )\n    variational_training1.append(var1)\n\n    var2 = circuit_evals_variational(\n        n_data=M, n_params=round(np.sqrt(M)), n_steps=M,\n        shift_terms=2, split=0.75, batch_size=1\n    )\n    variational_training2.append(var2)\n\n    kernel = circuit_evals_kernel(n_data=M, split=0.75)\n    kernelbased_training.append(kernel)\n\n    nn = model_evals_nn(\n        n_data=M, n_params=M, n_steps=M, split=0.75, batch_size=1\n    )\n    nn_training.append(nn)\n\n\nplt.plot(x_axis, nn_training, linestyle='--', label=\"neural net\")\nplt.plot(x_axis, variational_training1, label=\"var. circuit (linear param scaling)\")\nplt.plot(x_axis, variational_training2, label=\"var. circuit (srqt param scaling)\")\nplt.plot(x_axis, kernelbased_training, label=\"(quantum) kernel\")\nplt.xlabel(\"size of data set\")\nplt.ylabel(\"number of evaluations\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["This is the plot we saw at the beginning.\nWith current hardware-compatible training methods, whether kernel-based training\nrequires more or fewer quantum circuit evaluations\nthan variational training depends on how many parameters the latter needs.\nIf variational circuits turn out to be as parameter-hungry as neural networks,\nkernel-based training will outperform them for common machine learning tasks.
